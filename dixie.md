## Political polarization

Replicating the same unstable political dichotomy of the past decade is to be avoided. Taking the 2024 presidential vote as a proxy for political values, each nation should have a clear majority.

The recent and historical margins for New Dixie show a consistent political majority.

## Assessment

With its long shoreline of low-lying areas, New Dixie will be affected by sea level rise as well as hotter temperatures, droughts and extreme weather events. Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and South Carolina rely entirely on immigration for population growth, and only Georgia has a substantial excess of births over deaths. New Dixie's global foreign policy will be oriented toward the Caribbean and South America.
