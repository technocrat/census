## Political polarization

Replicating the same unstable political dichotomy of the past decade is to be avoided. Taking the 2024 presidential vote as a proxy for political values, each nation should have a clear majority.

If the recent marked difference between the two parties reverts to the long-term mean, there appears to be a stable political majority for The Lone Star Republic.


## Assessment

Texas has robust natural growth combined with strong immigration. Even with immigration, Louisiana is losing population. Arkansas and Oklahoma both depend on immigration to maintain population levels. The regional economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas, which are vulnerable to both depletion and trends toward carbon-neutral energy sources. It does, however, have vast expanses of flat land with low agricultural productivity that is suitable for solar power. This will require, however, in the case of Texas electricity grid infrastructure improvements to connect to markets outside of Texas.
