## MODULE EXPORTS POLICY

All functions defined in `src/` and any functions they depend upon, along with all constants exposed from `constants.jl`, shall be automatically available to any script that includes `using Census` unless specifically excluded by user directive.

### Implementation Requirements

1. All functions in `src/` directories must be exported by default
2. All constants defined in `constants.jl` must be exported by default
3. All dependent functions required by exported functions must also be exported
4. Functions should only be excluded from export if specifically directed by user
5. The module should maintain a comprehensive export list in `src/Census.jl`

### Usage

Scripts should only need to include:
```julia
using Census
```

All functionality should be available through this single import unless specifically excluded.
