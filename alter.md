# Alternatives

Most states contain geographic, economic, social and political diversity, and portions of states have more in common with adjoining states than with their own. Using a county based approach, several adjustments could be made.

## Concordia

Maine, byond Bangor might be ceded to Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada. The New York City commutershed in Connecticut is perhaps a better part of Metropolis. The New York portion of the Lake Champlain drainage, including Plattsburg, would be a natural fito for Concordia.

## Metropolis

Besides spinning off the Lake Champlain region, Metropolis would not lose much by ceding the drainage into the Great Lakes, including Rochester and Buffalo. It could acquire the Delaware River basin of Pennsylvania along with its portion of the Susquehana and Potomoc River Basins. The Alleghany River basin drainage would become part of a nation organized around the Ohio River basin. This would bring Philadelphia from Factoria into Metropolis. The southern boundary of Metropolis could be terminated at the Cheasapeake River basin rather than further south at the Virginia-North Carolina state line.

## Factoria

Factoria could be divided into a Great Lakes basin portion, encompassing Detroit, the Michigan Peninsula and Cleveland, and an Ohio River basin portion, including most of Cumberland and small portions of New Dixie. Chicago would be added to Heartlandia.

## Cumberland

Most of Cumberland would be absorbed into the Ohio River basin based Factoria.

## Heartlandia

 Heartlandia could be reconfigured to take in the Upper Mississippi Basin, including Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Milwaukee plus the Michigan Upper Penninsula. The northern most portions of Minnesota and North Dakota might be ceded to Manitoba and Ontario. The Missouri River basin portion of the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming Colorado, Kansas and Missouri would form a new nation, The Plains.

## The Lone Star Republic

 The Lone Star Republic would be organized around the river basins draining into the lower Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. This would include all of present day Texas and Arkansas and parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Missouri and Louisiana (west of the Mississippi River).

## Deseret

Deseret could be expanded to take in the entire Colorado River basin and California east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range as well as Pacifica east of the Cascade Mountain range and Montana west of the Continental Divide.

## New Dixie

New Dixie could gain the southern portion of Virginia, the eastern portion of Louisiana while giving up the portions draining into the Ohio River basin on the north and gaining the portions of Kentucky and Tennessee draining directly into the Mississippi.

## New Sonora

As well as trimming California east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and spinning off Nevada, New Sonora could also cede the region to the east of the Salton Sea to Deseret.
