{{insert /partials/Concordia_births_table.html}}	 
~~~

The general fertility rate in the United States as a whole was 54.4 births per 1,000 females ages 15–44, and the estimated total fertility rate per thousand women for the United State is approximately 1.62, which is less than the 2.1 rate to maintain population levels in the absence of migration.

Together with the District of Columbia and Oregon, the Concordia  states have the lowest total fertility rates in the United States. Massachusetts and Connecticut have death rates below the national average, while the other New England states have rates that are higher.

When birthrates are below the 2.1 rate, immigration is needed to prevent population decline (and with it economic decline). Either domestic or international, or a combination, immigration is required to make up the numbers.
