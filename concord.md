All of Concordia lies within 200 miles of Boston except for northeastern Maine, which is sparsely settled. It is bordered by Quebec, Canada on the north and by New Brunswick, Canada on the east. It borders New York on the west and south. Approximately 75% of the region is forested.

## Population

Concordia is home to approximately 15.1 million in the six states of Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont. As a single state, it would be the fifth largest, behind New York and ahead of Pennsylvania. It has about 4.5% of the total population of the United States.

The age distribution differences are reflected in the dependency ratios for the  Concordia states.

A lower dependency ratio indicates a higher proportion of the population in the 16-65 age group. For the US as a whole, the ratio is 52.86.

## Birth Rates

~~~
{{insert /partials/Concordia_births_table.html}}	 
~~~

The general fertility rate in the United States as a whole was 54.4 births per 1,000 females ages 15–44, and the estimated total fertility rate per thousand women for the United State is approximately 1.62, which is less than the 2.1 rate to maintain population levels in the absence of migration.

Together with the District of Columbia and Oregon, the Concordia  states have the lowest total fertility rates in the United States. Massachusetts and Connecticut have death rates below the national average, while the other New England states have rates that are higher.

When birthrates are below the 2.1 rate, immigration is needed to prevent population decline (and with it economic decline). Either domestic or international, or a combination, immigration is required to make up the numbers.

### Manufacturing

Concordia’s industries include high-value specialty chemicals specialty polymers, pharmaceutical intermediates, and advanced materials used in electronics, healthcare, and other high-tech sectors. Its aerospace industry includes propulsion, avionics, and systems engineering for unmanned systems, advanced sensor technologies, satellite components, and precision-engineered aerospace parts. General Dynamics Electric Boat division designs, manufactures, maintains and retrofits submarines for the U.S. Navy.

The six Concordia states collectively exported \$67.5 billion in goods to the world in 2024, with Massachusetts leading at \$34.9 billion, followed by Connecticut at \$17.4 billion, New Hampshire at \$7.1 billion and Rhode Island at \$3.1 billion. Maine at \$3.1 billion and Vermont at \$1.9 billion. The region’s economic strength in trade goods lies in sectors such as chemical manufacturing, aerospace, computer and electronic products and precision machinery. However, most states face trade deﬁcits due to reliance on imports for raw materials and consumer goods. Services exports, particularly in education, digital trade, and management consulting, play a signiﬁcant role in offsetting goods deficits, with Massachusetts and Connecticut each exporting \$15 billion in 2023. 


### Agriculture

Concordia's agriculture is a diversified mix of livestock, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. The principal monoculture farming is the potato fields of Arostook County in Maine. Fishing and aquaculture activity includes lobster, cod, haddock and clams.

### Resource Extraction

Maine has a timber and paper industry and Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts quarry dimension stone.

### Services

Financial services, education, healthcare, intellectual property licensing, information technology, and professional consulting, together with tourism, are the leading components of exports in services.

### Balance of trade

Massachusetts and Connecticut, despite high export values, have international trade deficits of \$16.3 billion and \$5.6 billion respectively in goods. New Hampshire maintains a smaller deficit of \$1.9 billion, while Rhode Island experiences a substantial \$12.4 billion shortfall. Maine’s international trade deficit reaches \$15.0 billion, primarily due to petroleum imports. Vermont, with limited data available, shows an estimated \$500 million deficit.

Domestically, Maine has a \$79.3 billion trade surplus with other U.S. states, driven by forest products and seafood exports. Massachusetts and Connecticut leverage their tech and aerospace sectors for positive domestic balances of \$12.9 billion and \$3.8 billion respectively. New Hampshire and Vermont also maintain modest domestic surpluses, while Rhode Island is the only state with a negative balance in both international and domestic trade.

## Political polarization

Replicating the same unstable political dichotomy of the past decade is to be avoided. Taking the 2024 presidential vote as a proxy for political values, each nation should have a clear majority.

Even should the recent marked difference between the two parties should revert to the long-term mean, there appears to be a stable political majority for Concordia.

## Assessment

### Demographics

Concordia has a slight demographic advantage over other nations due to its absorption of immigrants. Maine and Vermont, however, have aging populations and limited occupational opportunities for immigrants

### Economics

Assuming that US markets remain open to Concordia, it would be a viable standalone nation if it continues to absorb foreign immigration and can meet challenges in housing costs.

### Diversity

Concordia has diverse landscapes—coastal, mountains and valleys. 

### Climate change

@@marginnote [Climate Impacts – New England and Northern New York](https://forestadaptation.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/New-England-Northern-New-York-Climate-Impacts.pdf)@@

The concentration of population in coastal areas makes Concordia vulnerable to sea level rise, which may reach 23 inches by the end of the century. In conjunction with increased storm activity, investments in urban runoff control will be required. Foresty impacts will slowly develop as existing species mixes give way to species better adapted to warmer, drier climates. Meterological winter will be shorter and drier. Natural landscape adaptation to changed conditions will require decades and the human landscape will also take time to adjust. Most of Concordia's economy is not directly vulnerable to climate change.                          

### Economics

Concordia has low dependence on natural resources, and its economy won't be directly affect by depletion of such commodities as oil and minerals. Concordia's knowledge based economy will continue to rely on investment in primary and secondary education.

### Geopolitics

Concordia can be expected to cultivate friendly relations with Canada to its north and Metropolis to its west. It has no obvious reasons to come into conflict with China, as it emerges as the global hemegon. It will continue to look to Europe as a major trade partner.

## Governance

Because Concordia's state have diverse demographic and economic profiles, its constitution will have to strike a balance between democratic majority rule, which favors urban Massachusetts and Connecticut, and place-based autonomy. It should be cautious not to bake in geographic divisions in political power, however, so that as political and social differences and commonalities develop that power dynamic can adjust accordingly.
