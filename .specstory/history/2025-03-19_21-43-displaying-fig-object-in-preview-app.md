# Displaying Fig Object in Preview App (2025-03-19 14:43:04)

I want to display the fig object at the end of the script in the preview app

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the script to display the figure in the preview app. In Julia, to display a figure in the preview app, we need to use `display(fig)` at the end of the script.

Let me edit the file to add this:


---

```diff
  add_labels!(df, ga1, :geoid, fontsize=6)
  fig
+ display(fig)
  
  
```

---

I've added `display(fig)` at the end of the script. This will ensure that the figure is displayed in the preview app when you run the script. The `display()` function is Julia's standard way to show objects in the appropriate display context, and in this case, it will render the figure in the preview app.

You can now run the script and the figure should appear in the preview app. The figure will show your map with the population data visualization, including the labels and color scheme you've defined.
