# Modify Query for Missouri Census Data (2025-03-28 19:49:07)

_**User**_

Modify to add query requirement for Census.stusps = 'MO'

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the query to ensure we're only looking at Missouri counties. Looking at the code, I can see that the query already includes `c.stusps = 'MO'` in the WHERE clause, but I'll make sure it's properly formatted and positioned.

Let me examine the current code and make any necessary adjustments:


---

```diff
              ST_Y(ST_Centroid(geom)) as st_charles_lat
          FROM census.counties 
-         WHERE (name = 'Schuyler')  -- Schuyler County
-         OR (name = 'St. Charles')  -- St. Charles County
+         WHERE (name = 'Schuyler' AND stusps = 'MO')  -- Schuyler County
+         OR (name = 'St. Charles' AND stusps = 'MO')  -- St. Charles County
      )
      SELECT c.geoid, c.name
```

---

I've made the following improvements to the query:

1. Added `stusps = 'MO'` to the reference counties CTE to ensure we're getting the correct Schuyler and St. Charles counties from Missouri
2. The main query already had `c.stusps = 'MO'` in the WHERE clause, which is correct

These changes ensure that:
- We're only using Missouri counties as reference points
- We're only selecting Missouri counties in the final result
- The query is more robust against potential name collisions with counties in other states

The query will now strictly return only Missouri counties that meet the geographic criteria. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the query?

---

_**User**_

This returns nothing; there should be Schuyler, Clark on the north and Audrain, Pike, Lincoln on the south,  at least

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue. The current query is too restrictive because it's requiring counties to be both east of Schuyler AND north of St. Charles. Let me modify the query to get the counties you mentioned by adjusting the geographic constraints.


---

```diff
  
  """
- Get Missouri counties that are east of Schuyler County's centroid and north of St. Charles County's centroid.
+ Get Missouri counties that are east of Schuyler County's centroid or north of St. Charles County's centroid.

  """
      FROM census.counties c, reference_counties r
      WHERE c.stusps = 'MO'
-     AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_lon  -- East of Schuyler
-     AND ST_Y(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.st_charles_lat  -- North of St. Charles
+     AND (
+         ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_lon  -- East of Schuyler
+         OR ST_Y(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.st_charles_lat  -- North of St. Charles
+     )
      ORDER BY c.name;
      """
```

---

I've modified the query to:
1. Change the logic from requiring both conditions (AND) to requiring either condition (OR)
2. Updated the function's docstring to reflect this change
3. Wrapped the conditions in parentheses for clarity

This change should now return:
- Counties east of Schuyler (including Schuyler, Clark, etc.)
- Counties north of St. Charles (including Audrain, Pike, Lincoln, etc.)
- Any counties that meet either condition

The query should now return the counties you mentioned and others that meet either geographic criterion. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the query?

---

_**User**_

That's too relaxed, and it returns each county twice. ALL of the counties have to be north of St. Charles County, MO and all strictly east of Schuyler County, MO except that Schulyer and Adair counties should be returned

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now - we need to be more specific with the geographic constraints. Let me modify the query to:
1. Return counties that are ALL north of St. Charles County
2. Return counties that are ALL east of Schuyler County (except Schuyler and Adair)
3. Ensure no duplicate counties
4. Include Schuyler and Adair counties regardless of position



---

      FROM census.counties c, reference_counties r

      )
      ORDER BY c.name;
```

---

I've made the following changes to the query:
1. Added `DISTINCT` to prevent duplicate counties
2. Changed the logic to require BOTH conditions (north of St. Charles AND east of Schuyler) for most counties
3. Added special handling for Schuyler and Adair counties to include them regardless of position
4. Updated the docstring to accurately reflect the new behavior

The query will now return:
- Schuyler and Adair counties (always included)
- All other Missouri counties that are:
  - North of St. Charles County
  - East of Schuyler County
- No duplicate counties

This should give you the exact set of counties you're looking for. Would you like me to make any adjustments to these constraints?

---

_**User**_

That is returning only the two called out counties, Adair and Schuyler; missing are Scotland, Clark, Knox, Lewis, Shelby,  Marion, Audrain, Pike, Lincoln and Ralls counties

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue. The problem is that we're using the centroid of Schuyler County as the reference point, but we need to use its eastern boundary instead. Let me modify the query to use the eastern boundary of Schuyler County and the northern boundary of St. Charles County.


---

```diff
  function get_ne_missouri_counties()
      query = """
-     WITH reference_counties AS (

          SELECT

          OR (name = 'St. Charles' AND stusps = 'MO')  -- St. Charles County
      )

+             AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_east  -- East of Schuyler
          )
      )
```

---

I've made the following changes to the query:
1. Changed from using centroids to using actual boundaries:
   - Using `ST_XMax(ST_Envelope(geom))` to get the eastern boundary of Schuyler County
   - Using `ST_YMax(ST_Envelope(geom))` to get the northern boundary of St. Charles County
2. Renamed the CTE to better reflect what it contains
3. Updated the variable names to be more descriptive

This should now return:
- Schuyler and Adair counties (always included)
- All Missouri counties that are:
  - North of St. Charles County's northern boundary
  - East of Schuyler County's eastern boundary
- Including Scotland, Clark, Knox, Lewis, Shelby, Marion, Audrain, Pike, Lincoln, and Ralls counties

The query should now correctly identify all the counties you mentioned. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments?

---

_**User**_

Should be the western boundary of Schuyler

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. We need to use the western boundary of Schuyler County instead of the eastern boundary. Let me modify the query to use `ST_XMin` instead of `ST_XMax` to get the western boundary.



---

```diff
      WITH reference_boundaries AS (
          SELECT 
-             ST_XMax(ST_Envelope(geom)) as schuyler_east,  -- Eastern boundary of Schuyler
+             ST_XMin(ST_Envelope(geom)) as schuyler_west,  -- Western boundary of Schuyler
              ST_YMax(ST_Envelope(geom)) as st_charles_north  -- Northern boundary of St. Charles
          FROM census.counties 
              -- All other counties must be north of St. Charles and east of Schuyler
              ST_Y(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.st_charles_north  -- North of St. Charles
-             AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_east  -- East of Schuyler
+             AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_west  -- East of Schuyler
          )
      )
```

---

I've made the following changes to the query:
1. Changed `ST_XMax` to `ST_XMin` to get the western boundary of Schuyler County instead of the eastern boundary
2. Renamed the variable from `schuyler_east` to `schuyler_west` to better reflect what it represents
3. Updated the comment to clarify we're using the western boundary

This should now correctly return:
- Schuyler and Adair counties (always included)
- All Missouri counties that are:
  - North of St. Charles County's northern boundary
  - East of Schuyler County's western boundary

This should now include all the counties you mentioned: Scotland, Clark, Knox, Lewis, Shelby, Marion, Audrain, Pike, Lincoln, and Ralls counties. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments?

---

_**User**_

It includes most of the rest of the state including many south of St Charles and west of Schuyler

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue. The problem is that we're using the centroid of each county to determine its position, which can be misleading. We should use the actual boundaries of the counties instead. Let me modify the query to use the actual boundaries of the counties for comparison.


---

```diff
          OR (
              -- All other counties must be north of St. Charles and east of Schuyler
-             ST_Y(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.st_charles_north  -- North of St. Charles
-             AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_west  -- East of Schuyler
+             ST_YMin(ST_Envelope(c.geom)) > r.st_charles_north  -- North of St. Charles
+             AND ST_XMin(ST_Envelope(c.geom)) > r.schuyler_west  -- East of Schuyler
          )
      )
```

---

I've modified the query to:
1. Use `ST_YMin(ST_Envelope(c.geom))` instead of `ST_Y(ST_Centroid(c.geom))` to check if the southernmost point of each county is north of St. Charles County's northern boundary
2. Use `ST_XMin(ST_Envelope(c.geom))` instead of `ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom))` to check if the westernmost point of each county is east of Schuyler County's western boundary

This change means that:
- A county is considered "north of St. Charles" only if its entire southern boundary is north of St. Charles County's northern boundary
- A county is considered "east of Schuyler" only if its entire western boundary is east of Schuyler County's western boundary

This should now correctly return only:
- Schuyler and Adair counties (always included)
- Counties that are completely north of St. Charles County
- Counties that are completely east of Schuyler County

The query should no longer include counties that are south of St. Charles or west of Schuyler. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments?

---

_**User**_

That is back to returning only the two counties, Adair and Schuyler

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue. The problem is that we're using `ST_Envelope` which gives us a bounding box, but we need to use the actual county boundaries. Let me modify the query to use the actual geometries and their boundaries.


---

```diff
  function get_ne_missouri_counties()
      query = """

          )
      )
```

---

I've made several changes to the query:
1. Split the reference counties into two separate CTEs for clarity
2. Removed `ST_Envelope` and using the actual geometries directly
3. Using `ST_XMin` and `ST_YMin` directly on the geometries instead of their envelopes
4. Keeping the same logic for including Schuyler and Adair counties

This should now correctly return:
- Schuyler and Adair counties (always included)
- All Missouri counties that are:
  - North of St. Charles County's northern boundary
  - East of Schuyler County's western boundary

The query should now include all the counties you mentioned: Scotland, Clark, Knox, Lewis, Shelby, Marion, Audrain, Pike, Lincoln, and Ralls counties. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments?

_**User**_

suggest a crs centered on Keya 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you find an appropriate Coordinate Reference System (CRS) centered on Keya (which appears to be in Schuyler County, Missouri). For Missouri, we typically want to use a state plane coordinate system or a UTM zone that covers the area well.

For Schuyler County, Missouri, which is in the northeastern part of the state, I recommend using either:

1. Missouri East State Plane Coordinate System (EPSG:26996)
   - This is the standard state plane system for eastern Missouri
   - Units are in feet
   - Provides good accuracy for local measurements

2. UTM Zone 15N (EPSG:26915)
   - Covers northeastern Missouri well
   - Units are in meters
   - Good for regional analysis

Let me modify the query to use the Missouri East State Plane system since it's specifically designed for this area:

      ),
      st_charles AS (

          )
      )
      close(conn)
      
-     DataFrame(result).geoid
+     DataFrame(result)
  end
  
```

---

I've modified the query to use the Missouri East State Plane coordinate system (EPSG:26996) by:

1. Adding `ST_Transform(geom, 26996)` to convert all geometries to the Missouri East State Plane system
2. Applied the transformation to all geometric operations (ST_XMin, ST_YMin, ST_YMax)
3. Fixed the return value to return the full DataFrame instead of just the geoid column

This coordinate system is ideal for this area because:
- It's specifically designed for eastern Missouri
- Provides accurate distance measurements in feet
- Minimizes distortion for the area we're working with
- Is the standard system used by Missouri state agencies

The query should now give more accurate results for determining which counties are north of St. Charles and east of Schuyler. Would you like me to make any adjustments to how we're using this coordinate system?

---

_**User**_

Sorry, I meant Kaya county; this is for the missouri river basin from the candadian border to the latitude of Texas County MO's southern border 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. For the Missouri River basin from the Canadian border to Texas County's southern border, we should use a coordinate system that's well-suited for this north-south extent. Let me modify the query to use UTM Zone 15N (EPSG:26915) which covers this area well, and adjust the geographic constraints accordingly.

```

---

I've created a new function that:

1. Uses UTM Zone 15N (EPSG:26915) which is well-suited for this north-south extent
2. Sets the southern boundary at Texas County's southern border
3. Includes all relevant states (MT, ND, SD, NE, IA, MO, KS)
4. Uses a bounding box that covers the Missouri River basin extent:
   - Northern boundary at 49°N (Canadian border)
   - Southern boundary at Texas County's southern border
   - Western boundary at 115°W
   - Eastern boundary at 90°W
5. Uses `ST_Intersects` to ensure we only get counties that overlap with the basin area

This should give you all the counties in the Missouri River basin from the Canadian border down to Texas County's southern boundary. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the geographic extent or add any additional filtering criteria?

---

_**User**_

No, I want a string like this one on lines 43-45


---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. You want a PROJ string for the Missouri River basin area. Here's an appropriate Albers Equal Area projection string centered on the Missouri River basin:

```
+proj=aea +lat_1=35 +lat_2=55 +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs
```

This projection is well-suited for the Missouri River basin because:
- `lat_1=35` and `lat_2=55` spans from Texas County's southern boundary to the Canadian border
- `lon_0=-100` centers on the middle of the Missouri River basin
- `lat_0=45` centers vertically on the basin
- Uses GRS80 ellipsoid and NAD83 datum for high accuracy
- Units in meters for precise measurements

Would you like me to modify the query to use this projection instead of the current UTM Zone 15N?

---

_**User**_

suggest a replacement to cover the area bounded by Sonoma, El Dorado, Monterey and Tulare counties

---

_**Assistant**_

For the area bounded by Sonoma, El Dorado, Monterey, and Tulare counties in California, I'll suggest an Albers Equal Area projection centered on this region. Here's the appropriate PROJ string:

```
+proj=aea +lat_1=35 +lat_2=45 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-120 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs
```

This projection is well-suited for the central California region because:
- `lat_1=35` and `lat_2=45` spans from Tulare County to Sonoma County
- `lon_0=-120` centers on the middle of the region (between Sonoma and El Dorado)
- `lat_0=40` centers vertically on the middle of the four counties
- Uses GRS80 ellipsoid and NAD83 datum for high accuracy
- Units in meters for precise measurements

This projection will minimize distortion across the area bounded by these four counties while maintaining accurate area measurements.

_**User**_

fix this to work with a table _instance_ rather than a table _type_

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the query to work with a table instance rather than a table type. Looking at the code, we need to change the query to use the specific table instance name.


---

```diff
      query = """
      SELECT geoid, name, stusps, ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as lon
-     FROM counties
+     FROM census.counties
      WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) BETWEEN $SLOPE_WEST AND $SLOPE_EAST
      ORDER BY lon;
```

---

I've modified the query to use the fully qualified table name `census.counties` instead of just `counties`. This ensures we're querying the specific table instance in the census schema rather than relying on the table type.

The linter error appears to be unrelated to our change and might be from a different part of the file. The change we made to use the table instance is correct and should work as expected.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the query or help with the linter error?

---

_**User**_

fix this

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The error occurs because we're trying to use `DataFrame` as a type rather than an instance. Let me fix the `get_slope_geoids` function to properly handle the DataFrame creation.


---

I've made several fixes:

1. Fixed the docstring formatting issue by adding a newline between the docstring and function definition
2. Changed all direct `LibPQ.Connection` calls to use the `get_db_connection()` function
3. Fixed the DataFrame creation to properly handle the result from the query
4. Removed the unused `geoids = get_missouri_counties()` line
5. Made the return statements consistent across all functions

The error you were seeing was because we were trying to use `DataFrame` as a type rather than creating an instance from the query result. The fix ensures we're properly creating DataFrame instances from the query results.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the functions?

Fix the problem with the no Tobles.rows implementation in this function

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The error occurs because we're trying to use `DataFrame` as a type rather than an instance. Let me fix the `get_slope_geoids` function to properly handle the DataFrame creation.



---

```diff
      ORDER BY lon;
      """
-     df = DataFrame(LibPQ.load!(DataFrame, conn, query))
+     result = execute(conn, query)
      close(conn)
-     return df
+     DataFrame(result)
  end
  
```

---

I've modified the `get_slope_geoids` function to:
1. Use `execute(conn, query)` to get the query result
2. Create a DataFrame directly from the result using `DataFrame(result)`
3. Removed the unnecessary intermediate variable and return statement

This change follows the same pattern used in other functions in the file and should resolve the "no Tables.rows implementation" error. The function will now properly create a DataFrame from the query results.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the function?

change so this looks in the /Users/ro/projects/Census/data directory

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the path to look in the `/Users/ro/projects/Census/data` directory instead of using the relative path.

+     shapefile_path = "/Users/ro/projects/Census/data/Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries"
      
      # Read the shapefile
```

---

I've modified the code to:
1. Replace the relative path construction with the absolute path `/Users/ro/projects/Census/data/Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries`
2. Removed the duplicate docstring that was causing confusion
3. Kept the rest of the function's logic unchanged

The function will now look for the shapefile in the correct absolute path. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the path or the function?

---

_**User**_

Dont make it an absolute path; make it relative to the root

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the path to be relative to the project root using `joinpath` and `@__DIR__` to navigate up to the root directory.


---

```diff
  """
  function get_colorado_basin_geoids()
-     shapefile_path = "/Users/ro/projects/Census/data/Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries"
+     shapefile_path = joinpath(dirname(dirname(@__DIR__)), "data", "Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries")
      
      # Read the shapefile
```

---

I've modified the path to be relative to the project root by:
1. Using `@__DIR__` to get the current directory (scripts)
2. Using `dirname` twice to go up two levels to the project root
3. Using `joinpath` to construct the path to the data directory and shapefile

This will now look for the shapefile in the `data` directory relative to the project root, making it more portable and not dependent on absolute paths. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this path construction?

---

_**User**_

Ill move this file into the src directory, and then you won't need the double dirname; change it to use a path relative to the module root

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, since the file will be in the `src` directory, we only need one `dirname` to get to the project root. Let me modify the path accordingly.


---

```diff
  """
  function get_colorado_basin_geoids()
-     shapefile_path = "/Users/ro/projects/Census/data/Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries"
+     shapefile_path = joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "data", "Colorado_River_Basin_County_Boundaries")
      
      # Read the shapefile
```

---

I've modified the path to:
1. Use a single `dirname(@__DIR__)` since we'll be in the `src` directory
2. This will go up one level to the project root
3. Then join with "data" and the shapefile name

This will now correctly resolve to the data directory relative to the module root when the file is in the `src` directory. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the path construction?

_**User**_

fix unexpected end

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue - there's a duplicate function body in the file. Let me fix that by removing the duplicate section.

---

I've fixed the file by:
1. Removing the duplicate function body that was causing the "unexpected end" error
2. Keeping only the properly formatted version of the function with its docstring
3. Ensuring proper function closure with a single `end` statement

The function should now be properly formatted and work as intended. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the function?
