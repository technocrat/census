# Creating df.nation from State Abbreviations (2025-03-24 15:43:25)

_**User**_

create df.nation by matching df.stusps, nations and titles

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a new column `df.nation` by matching state abbreviations (`df.stusps`) with corresponding nations and titles. First, let me check if we have access to the nations and titles data or if we need to create these mappings.

Let me search for any existing code or data related to nations and titles.

Based on the search results, I can see that we have the necessary data structures defined in the codebase. I'll help you create the `nation` column in your dataframe by matching the state abbreviations (`df.stusps`) with the corresponding nations and titles.

Let me edit the `entry.jl` file to add this functionality:

---

```diff
  rename!(df, [:geoid, :stusps, :county, :geom, :pop])
  
+ # Add nation column by matching state abbreviations with nations and titles
+ df.nation = [get_nation_title(state, nations, Titles) for state in df.stusps]
  
  fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800), fontsize=22)
```

---

I've added code to create a new column `df.nation` by using a list comprehension that applies the `get_nation_title` function to each state abbreviation in `df.stusps`. This function will:

1. Take each state abbreviation from `df.stusps`
2. Look up which nation it belongs to using the `nations` array of arrays
3. Return the corresponding title from the `Titles` array

The resulting `df.nation` column will contain the full names of the nations (like "Concordia", "Cumberland", etc.) that each state belongs to.

For example:
- States like "CT", "MA", "ME" will be mapped to "Concordia"
- States like "WV", "KY", "TN" will be mapped to "Cumberland"
- And so on...

Is there anything specific about the nation assignments that you'd like me to explain or modify?

---

_**User**_

produce dataframe pop with totals of df.pop by df.nation

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a new dataframe `pop` that aggregates the population totals by nation using the `combine` function from DataFrames.jl.

---

```diff
  # Add nation column by matching state abbreviations with nations and titles
  df.nation = [get_nation_state(state) for state in df.stusps]
+ 
+ # Create population totals by nation
+ pop = combine(groupby(df, :nation), :pop => sum => :total)
+ sort!(pop, :nation)
  
  
```

---

I've added code that:

1. Uses `groupby(df, :nation)` to group the data by nation
2. Uses `combine()` with the pair `:pop => sum => :total` to:
   - Take the `:pop` column
   - Apply the `sum` function to it
   - Name the resulting column `:total`
3. Sorts the resulting dataframe by nation name

The resulting `pop` dataframe will have two columns:
- `:nation`: The name of each nation (e.g., "Concordia", "Cumberland", etc.)
- `:total`: The total population for each nation

The dataframe will be sorted alphabetically by nation name for easy reading. You can now use this `pop` dataframe to analyze or visualize the population distribution across the different nations.

Would you like me to add any additional calculations or formatting to the population totals?

---

_**User**_

add gdp.nation using gdp.state and Titles

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I notice that `gdp` is already created from `gdp_state` which should have the nation information. However, if you want to ensure the nation column is properly set using the state codes and Titles, I'll help you add that.

---

```diff
  
  gdp       = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
+ sort!(gdp, :nation)
  
  
```

---

I've added `sort!(gdp, :nation)` to ensure the GDP data is sorted by nation name, matching the format of the population data. 

The code is already correctly handling the nation assignments since:

1. `gdp_state` was created using `make_nation_state_gdp_df(postals)` which should already include the proper nation assignments
2. The `combine` operation is grouping by the `:nation` column to calculate the GDP totals
3. The resulting `gdp` dataframe has the nations properly assigned

Both `pop` and `gdp` dataframes should now be sorted in the same order with their respective totals by nation. Each should have two columns:
- `pop`: [:nation, :total] (where total is population)
- `gdp`: [:nation, :total] (where total is GDP)

Would you like to see or modify how the nations are assigned in either dataframe?

---

_**User**_

The nations field isn't in gdp_state

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right! I see that `gdp_state` doesn't have the nation field yet, and I also notice there's a line creating `gdp_dfs` from `nations` that might be related. Let me help fix this.

---

```diff
  sort!(pop, :nation)
  
- gdp_dfs = [make_nation_state_gdp_df(s) for s in nations]
- states = gdp_state.state
- gdp       = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
+ gdp_state = make_nation_state_gdp_df(postals)
+ gdp_state.nation = [get_nation_state(state) for state in gdp_state.state]
+ 
+ gdp = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
  sort!(gdp, :nation)
  
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Removed the unused `gdp_dfs` line that was creating multiple dataframes
2. Removed the unused `states` assignment
3. Added proper creation of `gdp_state` using all postal codes
4. Added the nation assignment to `gdp_state` using the same `get_nation_state` function we used for the population data
5. Kept the grouping and sorting operations

Now the code will:
1. Create `gdp_state` with state-level GDP data
2. Add a `:nation` column to `gdp_state` by mapping each state to its corresponding nation
3. Group the data by nation and sum the GDP values
4. Sort the final `gdp` dataframe by nation name

Both `pop` and `gdp` dataframes should now have properly assigned nations and be sorted in the same order. Would you like me to add any additional processing or verification steps?

---

_**User**_

That returns gdp.nation as "Unknown"

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The `gdp_state.state` column might be using full state names while `get_nation_state` expects state abbreviations. Let me modify the code to handle this correctly.

---

```diff
  
  gdp_state = make_nation_state_gdp_df(postals)
- gdp_state.nation = [get_nation_state(state) for state in gdp_state.state]
+ gdp_state.nation = [get_nation_state(stusps) for stusps in gdp_state.stusps]
  
  gdp = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
```

---

I've changed the code to use `gdp_state.stusps` instead of `gdp_state.state`. This should now:

1. Use the state postal codes (like "MA", "NY", etc.) from the `stusps` column
2. Pass these abbreviations to `get_nation_state`
3. Get the correct nation names (like "Concordia", "Metropolis", etc.)

The `gdp` dataframe should now have proper nation names matching those in the `pop` dataframe. Would you like me to add any verification steps to confirm the nations are correctly assigned?

---

_**User**_

delete last row of a dataframe

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you delete the last row of a dataframe. In Julia, we can do this using array indexing with `1:end-1`.

---

```diff
  gdp = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
  sort!(gdp, :nation)
+ gdp = gdp[1:end-1, :]
  
  
```

---

I've added `gdp = gdp[1:end-1, :]` which will:
1. Select all rows except the last one (`1:end-1`)
2. Keep all columns (`:`)
3. Assign the result back to `gdp`

This will remove the last row from the `gdp` dataframe. The operation is non-destructive (creates a new dataframe) and then assigns it back to the same variable.

Would you like me to add any verification steps to confirm the last row was removed correctly?

Correct error in function

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice there's an error with the `collect_state_ages` function. Let me search for its definition and fix it.

---

I see the issue. The `collect_state_ages` function has an incorrect type specification in its signature. Let me fix that.

---

```diff
  # a dictionary nation using those abbreviations as a key with values of the
  # fully spelled out name and produces a vector of dataframes
- function collect_state_ages(state_vectors::Vector{String}, state_names::Dict)
+ function collect_state_ages(state_vectors::Vector{Vector{String}}, state_names::Dict)
      # Create a dictionary mapping state abbreviations to their DataFrames
      # Flatten all vectors and process each state once
```

---

I've fixed the function signature to correctly specify that `state_vectors` should be a `Vector{Vector{String}}` instead of just a `Vector{String}`. This matches how the function is being called with the `nations` variable, which is a vector of vectors where each inner vector contains state abbreviations for a particular nation.

The function will now:
1. Accept a vector of vectors of state abbreviations (`nations`)
2. Accept a dictionary mapping state abbreviations to full names (`state_names`)
3. Process each state's age data
4. Return a vector of DataFrames with dependency ratios for each nation

This should resolve the method error you were seeing. Would you like me to add any additional error checking or functionality to the function?

---

_**User**_

I now want to get the age weigthed dependency ratio for each nation

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you calculate the age-weighted dependency ratio for each nation. We'll need to aggregate the state-level data by nation and calculate the weighted ratio.

---

```diff
  
  age_dfs = collect_state_ages(nations, state_names)
+ 
+ # Calculate nation-level dependency ratios
+ nation_deps = DataFrame(nation = String[], dependency_ratio = Float64[])
+ for (i, nation_df) in enumerate(age_dfs)
+     nation_name = Titles[i]
+     # Get population weights for states in this nation
+     nation_states = nations[i]
+     state_pops = filter(row -> row.stusps in nation_states, df)
+     total_pop = sum(state_pops.pop)
+     weights = state_pops.pop ./ total_pop
+     
+     # Calculate weighted average dependency ratio
+     weighted_ratio = sum(nation_df.dependency_ratio .* weights)
+     push!(nation_deps, (nation_name, weighted_ratio))
+ end
+ sort!(nation_deps, :nation)
  
  
```

---

I've added code that:

1. Creates a new DataFrame `nation_deps` to store nation-level dependency ratios
2. For each nation:
   - Gets the corresponding age data from `age_dfs`
   - Gets the states in that nation from `nations`
   - Calculates population weights for each state using the population data from `df`
   - Computes the weighted average dependency ratio by:
     * Multiplying each state's dependency ratio by its population weight
     * Summing these weighted ratios to get the nation-level ratio
3. Sorts the results by nation name

The resulting `nation_deps` DataFrame has two columns:
- `:nation`: The name of each nation (from `Titles`)
- `:dependency_ratio`: The population-weighted dependency ratio for that nation

This gives us a more accurate picture of the dependency ratio for each nation by accounting for the different population sizes of their constituent states.

Would you like me to add any additional analysis or formatting to these ratios?

---

_**User**_

nation_states is the wrong table for this. Let's use pop_state at line 32

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, you're right. We should use `pop_state` which already has the state population totals calculated. Let me modify the code to use this table instead.

---

```diff
      # Get population weights for states in this nation
      nation_states = nations[i]
-     state_pops = filter(row -> row.stusps in nation_states, df)
-     total_pop = sum(state_pops.pop)
-     weights = state_pops.pop ./ total_pop
+     state_pops = filter(row -> row.stusps in nation_states, pop_state)
+     total_pop = sum(state_pops.total)
+     weights = state_pops.total ./ total_pop
      
      # Calculate weighted average dependency ratio
```

---

I've modified the code to:
1. Use `pop_state` instead of `df` for getting state populations
2. Use the `:total` column from `pop_state` instead of `:pop`
3. Keep the same weighting logic but with the pre-calculated state totals

This is more efficient since:
1. We're using the already aggregated state-level populations
2. We don't need to re-aggregate the county-level data
3. The filtering operation works on a smaller dataset

The results should be exactly the same, just calculated more efficiently. Would you like me to add any verification of the results or additional processing?

Fix missing comma

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the missing comma after "Heartlandia" in the dictionary.

---

```diff
- 
+ abbr_to_full = Dict(
+   "cumber"     => "Cumberland",
+   "dixie"      => "New Dixie",
+   "lonestar"   => "The Lone Star Republic",
+   "metropolis" => "Metropolis",
+   "heartland"  => "Heartlandia",
+   "factoria"   => "Factoria",
+   "desert"     => "Deseret",
+   "sonora"     => "New Sonora",
+   "concord"    => "Concordia",
+   "pacifica"   => "New Pacifica"
+ ) 
```

---

I've added the missing comma after `"Heartlandia"`. The dictionary definition should now be syntactically correct. Each key-value pair is properly separated by commas, making it a valid Julia dictionary definition.

---

_**User**_

That's what I thought, but everytime I run it is throws a "missing comma or ) error

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the file for any hidden characters or formatting issues. Sometimes invisible characters or specific line endings can cause syntax errors. Let me rewrite the dictionary definition completely:

---

```diff
  abbr_to_full = Dict(
-   "cumber"     => "Cumberland",
-   "dixie"      => "New Dixie",
-   "lonestar"   => "The Lone Star Republic",
+     "cumber" => "Cumberland",
+     "dixie" => "New Dixie",
+     "lonestar" => "The Lone Star Republic",
      "metropolis" => "Metropolis",
-   "heartland"  => "Heartlandia",
-   "factoria"   => "Factoria",
-   "desert"     => "Deseret",
-   "sonora"     => "New Sonora",
-   "concord"    => "Concordia",
-   "pacifica"   => "New Pacifica"
+     "heartland" => "Heartlandia",
+     "factoria" => "Factoria",
+     "desert" => "Deseret",
+     "sonora" => "New Sonora",
+     "concord" => "Concordia",
+     "pacifica" => "New Pacifica"
  ) 
```

---

I've rewritten the dictionary with:
1. Consistent indentation using spaces
2. Simplified spacing around the `=>` operator
3. No trailing whitespace
4. Standard line endings

If you're still getting the error, could you please try copying and pasting this exact version? Also, could you share the exact error message you're getting? That might help us identify if there's something else going on.

Also, just to be thorough, make sure there's no trailing whitespace after the closing parenthesis. Let me try one more time with absolutely minimal formatting:

---



---

If you're still getting the error, could you:
1. Show me the exact error message
2. Try running just this minimal version to see if it works
3. Let me know if you're copying this into the REPL or a file

This will help us identify where exactly the syntax error is coming from.

_**User**_

create gpd.nation by assigning gdp_state.state to one of Titles according to membership in nations

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create the nation assignments for the GDP data using the state memberships in `nations` and their corresponding `Titles`.

---

```diff
  
  gdp_state = make_nation_state_gdp_df(postals)
- gdp_state.nation = [get_nation_state(stusps) for stusps in gdp_state.stusps]
+ # Assign nations based on state membership
+ gdp_state.nation = fill("", nrow(gdp_state))
+ for (i, states) in enumerate(nations)
+     gdp_state.nation = ifelse.(in.(gdp_state.stusps, Ref(states)), Titles[i], gdp_state.nation)
+ end
  
  gdp = combine(groupby(gdp_state, :nation), :gdp => sum => :total)
```

---

I've modified the code to:

1. Initialize the `nation` column in `gdp_state` with empty strings
2. Iterate through each group of states in `nations` along with their index
3. Use `ifelse` with broadcasting to:
   - Check if each state in `gdp_state.stusps` is in the current group of states
   - If true, assign the corresponding title from `Titles[i]`
   - If false, keep the existing value
4. Keep the existing grouping and sorting operations

This approach:
- Directly uses the `nations` and `Titles` arrays to ensure consistent mapping
- Handles all states in one pass through the data
- Preserves the exact titles as defined in the `Titles` array

The resulting `gdp` dataframe will have nation names that exactly match those in `Titles`. Would you like me to add any verification steps to confirm the assignments are correct?

create dictionary that maps state postal abbreviations to Titles based on membership in nations

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a dictionary that maps state postal codes to their corresponding nation titles using the `nations` and `Titles` arrays.

---

```diff
  include(srcdir()*"/process_education_by_nation.jl")
  educ_attainment = process_education_by_nation(educ, nations)
+ 
+ # Create dictionary mapping state abbreviations to nation titles
+ state_to_nation = Dict{String,String}()
+ for (i, states) in enumerate(nations)
+     for state in states
+         state_to_nation[state] = Titles[i]
+     end
+ end
  
  
```

---

I've added code that:

1. Creates an empty dictionary `state_to_nation` that will map `String` keys (state postal codes) to `String` values (nation titles)
2. Iterates through each group of states in `nations` along with its index
3. For each state in a group, adds a mapping from that state's postal code to its corresponding nation title from `Titles`

For example, the dictionary will contain mappings like:
- "MA" => "Concordia"
- "TX" => "The Lone Star Republic"
- "CA" => "New Sonora"
etc.

You can now use this dictionary to easily look up which nation a state belongs to, like this:
```julia
state_to_nation["MA"]  # Returns "Concordia"
```

Would you like me to add any verification of the mappings or modify the dictionary structure in any way?
