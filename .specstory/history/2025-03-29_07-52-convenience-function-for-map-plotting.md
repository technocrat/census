# Convenience Function for Map Plotting (2025-03-29 00:52:44)

_**User**_

I'd like this block as a convenience function for use in all the files that use this standard code to plot maps

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help create a convenience function for this common map plotting pattern. First, let me search for other similar map plotting code to ensure we capture all use cases.

Based on the search results, I can see that this pattern is used consistently across multiple map plotting scripts. I'll create a convenience function that encapsulates this common pattern. Let me create a new file for this function.


---

```diff

+     
+     # Display the figure
+     display(fig)
+     
+     return fig
+ end 
```

---

Now I'll update the `powell.jl` script to use this new convenience function.


---

```diff
  dest = get_crs("powell")
  map_title = "Powell"
- # Create figure
- fig = Figure(size=(2400, 1600), fontsize=22)
  
  us              = get_geo_pop(Census.postals)
  df = vcat(mt,nm,wy,az,co,az,nd,sd,ne,ks,tx,ok,ut)
  
- rename!(df, [:geoid, :stusps, :county, :geom, :pop])
- breaks          = rcopy(get_breaks(df,5))
- df.pop_bins     = my_cut(df.pop, breaks[:kmeans][:brks])
- df.parsed_geoms = parse_geoms(df)
- map_poly(df, map_title, dest, fig)
- display(fig)
+ # Plot the map using the new convenience function
+ plot_map(df, map_title, dest)
  
  
```

---

I've created a new convenience function `plot_map` in `src/plot_map.jl` that encapsulates the common pattern used across multiple map plotting scripts. The function:

1. Takes a DataFrame with geographic data, map title, and destination projection as required arguments
2. Accepts optional keyword arguments for figure size and font size
3. Handles all the common data preparation steps:
   - Renaming columns
   - Setting up the R environment
   - Calculating breaks and population bins
   - Parsing geometries
4. Creates and displays the map using the existing `map_poly` function
5. Returns the figure for further customization if needed

I've also updated the `powell.jl` script to use this new function, which significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code while maintaining the same functionality.

The new function can be used in any of the other map plotting scripts in the same way. For example:

```julia
df = get_geo_pop(["CA"])
plot_map(df, "California", "+proj=aea +lat_1=35 +lat_2=45 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-120 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs")
```

Would you like me to update any of the other map plotting scripts to use this new convenience function?

---

_**User**_

Looks like it's not been properly exported

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, we need to export the `plot_map` function from the Census module. Let me check the module exports.

I see that we need to:
1. Include the `plot_map.jl` file in the Census module
2. Export the `plot_map` function

Let me update the Census module file:


---

```diff
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "my_cut.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "parse_geoms.jl"))
+ include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "plot_map.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "q.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "query_all_nation_ages.jl"))
  export my_cut 
  export parse_geoms 
+ export plot_map 
  export q 
  export query_all_nation_ages 
```

---

I've updated the Census module to:
1. Include the `plot_map.jl` file
2. Export the `plot_map` function

Now the `plot_map` function should be available when using the Census module. You'll need to restart Julia for the changes to take effect. After restarting, the `plot_map` function should work as expected in your scripts.

Would you like me to update any of the other map plotting scripts to use this new convenience function?

---

_**User**_

This isn't properly returning geoids in the longitude 100-115 range; it looks like they are all west of 115

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, I see the issue. The current query only checks if the longitude is less than the western boundary (115°W), but doesn't check for the eastern boundary (100°W). Let me fix that.


---

```diff
      FROM Census.counties
      WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < $WESTERN_BOUNDARY
+     AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $EASTERN_BOUNDARY
      ORDER BY lon;
      """
```

---

I've updated the `get_western_geoids()` function to add the eastern boundary check. Now it will only return counties that are:
1. West of 115°W (ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < $WESTERN_BOUNDARY)
2. East of 100°W (ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $EASTERN_BOUNDARY)

This should now correctly return only the counties in the high plains region between 100°W and 115°W longitude. You'll need to restart Julia for the changes to take effect.

Would you like me to help you test this change or make any other adjustments to the boundary definitions?

---

_**User**_

Are you sure of that? The longitude is in negative so 100 W is east of 115W

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion! Since we're dealing with negative longitudes (where -100°W is east of -115°W), we need to reverse the comparison operators. Let me fix that:



---

```diff
      SELECT geoid, name, stusps, ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as lon
      FROM Census.counties
-     WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < $WESTERN_BOUNDARY
-     AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $EASTERN_BOUNDARY
+     WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < $EASTERN_BOUNDARY
+     AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $WESTERN_BOUNDARY
      ORDER BY lon;
      """
```

---

Now the logic is correct:
- `ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < $EASTERN_BOUNDARY` (e.g., < -100) means west of 100°W
- `ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $WESTERN_BOUNDARY` (e.g., > -115) means east of 115°W

This will properly return counties between 100°W and 115°W longitude. The same fix should probably be applied to the other longitude-based functions in the file. Would you like me to review and fix those as well?

---

_**User**_

do that for eastern_geoids also

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, let me fix the `get_eastern_geoids()` function to properly handle the negative longitudes. The function should return counties between 90°W and 100°W longitude, so we need to check for values between -100 and -90.


---

```diff
      SELECT geoid, name, stusps, ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as lon
      FROM Census.counties
-     WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > $EASTERN_BOUNDARY
+     WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) > -100
+     AND ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) < -90
      ORDER BY lon;
      """
```

---

I've updated the `get_eastern_geoids()` function to:
1. Check for longitudes greater than -100° (west of 100°W)
2. Check for longitudes less than -90° (east of 90°W)

This will now correctly return counties between 90°W and 100°W longitude. I also notice that `get_east_of_utah_geoids()` and `get_east_of_cascade_geoids()` might need similar fixes. Would you like me to review and fix those as well?

---

_**User**_

save the plot to the Census/img directory using map_title and date_time

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the `plot_map` function to save the figure to the Census/img directory with a filename based on the map title and current date/time.


---

```diff
      # Plot map
      map_poly(df, map_title, dest, fig)
+     
+     # Create filename from map_title and current date/time
+     timestamp = Dates.format(now(), "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS")
+     safe_title = replace(map_title, " " => "_")
+     filename = joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "img", "$(safe_title)_$(timestamp).png")
+     
+     # Ensure img directory exists
+     mkpath(dirname(filename))
+     
+     # Save the figure
+     save(filename, fig)
      
      # Display the figure
```

---

I've updated the `plot_map` function to:
1. Create a timestamp in the format "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS"
2. Convert the map title to a safe filename by replacing spaces with underscores
3. Create a filename in the format "map_title_yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS.png"
4. Save the figure to the Census/img directory
5. Create the img directory if it doesn't exist

For example, if you call:
```julia
plot_map(df, "Powell", dest)
```

It will save the figure as something like:
```
Census/img/Powell_2024-03-21_14-30-45.png
```

The function still displays the figure and returns it, but now also saves it to disk. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the filename format or add any additional metadata to the saved files?

---

_**User**_

eliminate duplicates and export all

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll clean up the duplicates and export all the geoid constants in `scripts/geoids.jl`.


---

```diff

-        southern_kansas_geoids
  
```

---

I've cleaned up the file by:
1. Removing duplicate declarations of constants
2. Removing duplicate exports
3. Exporting all geoid constants in a single export statement
4. Organizing the constants in a logical order

Now all the geoid constants are properly defined once and exported, making them available to other modules that use the Census package. The exports include:
- `eastern_geoids`
- `western_geoids`
- `east_of_utah_geoids`
- `slope_geoids`
- `southern_kansas_geoids`
- `colorado_basin_geoids`
- `ne_missouri_geoids`
- `southern_missouri_geoids`
- `northern_missouri_geoids`
- `missouri_river_basin_geoids`

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the organization or naming of these constants?

---

_**User**_

rename get_slope_geoids() to get_east_of_cascade_geoids andname slope_geoids east_of_cascade_geoids

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll rename the function and its constant to better reflect their purpose.

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Renamed the function from `get_slope_geoids()` to `get_east_of_cascade_geoids()`
2. Renamed the constant from `slope_geoids` to `east_of_cascade_geoids`
3. Updated both export statements to use the new names
4. Fixed a typo in the SQL query where there was an extra space in `$CASCADE_ SLOPE_EAST`

The functionality remains exactly the same, but the names now better reflect their purpose of identifying counties east of the Cascade Mountains. Would you like me to make any other naming adjustments?

---

_**User**_

recheck all the exports; these need to be available in the scripts with simply a using Census statement

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll review and fix all the exports to ensure they're properly available when using `using Census`. The issue is that we need to make sure all the functions and constants are properly exported from the Census module.

Let me check the exports in the Census module:


---

```diff
  using .geoids: western_geoids, eastern_geoids, east_of_utah_geoids,
                east_of_cascade_geoids, southern_kansas_geoids, colorado_basin_geoids,
-               CRS_STRINGS, get_crs, east_of_sierras_geoids
+               CRS_STRINGS, get_crs, east_of_sierras_geoids, ne_missouri_geoids,

  export geoids, western_geoids, eastern_geoids, east_of_utah_geoids,
         east_of_cascade_geoids, southern_kansas_geoids, colorado_basin_geoids,
-        CRS_STRINGS, get_crs, east_of_sierras_geoids
+        CRS_STRINGS, get_crs, east_of_sierras_geoids, ne_missouri_geoids,
+        southern_missouri_geoids, northern_missouri_geoids, missouri_river_basin_geoids
  
  # # Define paths directly
  export install_r_packages  # Add install_r_packages to exports
  export LibPQ  # Add LibPQ to exports
+ 
  # Define and export utility functions
  function valid_codes()
```

---

I've updated the Census module to:
1. Add the missing geoid constants to the `using .geoids:` statement
2. Add the missing geoid constants to the `export` statement

Now all the geoid-related constants and functions should be available when using `using Census`. This includes:
- All the geoid constants (western_geoids, eastern_geoids, etc.)
- All the geoid getter functions (get_western_geoids, get_eastern_geoids, etc.)
- The CRS-related constants and functions

You'll need to restart Julia for these changes to take effect. After restarting, all these should be available with just a `using Census` statement.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because we're trying to export constants that haven't been defined yet. We need to move the exports after all the constants are defined. Let me fix this:

I've made several important changes to fix the issues:

1. Removed the early exports of geoid constants that were causing the `UndefVarError`
2. Added explicit definitions of all geoid constants after all the necessary functions are included
3. Renamed `get_slope_geoids` to `get_east_of_cascade_geoids` in the includes and exports
4. Moved all geoid constant exports to after they are defined
5. Organized the exports into logical groups (functions, constants, utilities)

The key changes are:
1. We now define the constants after all functions are loaded
2. We export the constants only after they are defined
3. We've fixed the naming to be consistent with the new `east_of_cascade_geoids` name

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` and ensure all exports are properly defined before being exported. After restarting Julia, all the geoid constants and functions should be available with a simple `using Census` statement.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

I notice that we're trying to use `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids()` but we haven't included the file that defines this function. Let me fix this by adding the missing include and ensuring all geoid-related functions are properly included:


---

```diff
  include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "highlighters.jl"))  # Syntax highlighting
  
- # Include all function files
+ # Include all geoid-related functions first
+ include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_western_geoids.jl"))

  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "gini.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "inspect_shapefile_structure.jl"))
```

---

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Added the missing include for `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids.jl`
2. Reorganized the includes to group all geoid-related functions together at the beginning
3. Removed duplicate includes of geoid-related functions that were scattered throughout the file
4. Ensured all geoid functions are included before they are used in the constant definitions

The key changes are:
1. Added a new section specifically for geoid-related functions
2. Added the missing `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids.jl` include
3. Removed duplicate includes of geoid functions that were scattered throughout the file
4. Maintained the correct order of includes to ensure dependencies are loaded before they're used

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` for `missouri_river_basin_geoids`. After restarting Julia, all geoid constants and functions should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

_**User**_

this is in the geoids.jl submodule

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The `get_east_of_cascade_geoids` function is defined in the geoids submodule, but we're trying to include it as a separate file. Let me fix this by removing the incorrect include and updating the exports:


---

```diff
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_eastern_geoids.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_east_of_utah_geoids.jl"))
- include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_east_of_cascade_geoids.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_southern_kansas_geoids.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_colorado_basin_geoids.jl"))
  const eastern_geoids = get_eastern_geoids()
  const east_of_utah_geoids = get_east_of_utah_geoids()
- const east_of_cascade_geoids = get_east_of_cascade_geoids()
+ const east_of_cascade_geoids = geoids.get_east_of_cascade_geoids()
  const southern_kansas_geoids = get_southern_kansas_geoids()
  const colorado_basin_geoids = get_colorado_basin_geoids()
  export get_nation_state 
  export get_nation_title 
- export get_east_of_cascade_geoids  # Renamed from get_slope_geoids
+ export get_east_of_cascade_geoids  # From geoids submodule
  export get_southern_kansas_geoids 
  export get_state_gdp 
```

---

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Removed the incorrect include for `get_east_of_cascade_geoids.jl` since it's part of the geoids submodule
2. Updated the constant definition to use `geoids.get_east_of_cascade_geoids()` to access the function from the submodule
3. Updated the export comment to clarify that the function comes from the geoids submodule

The key changes are:
1. Removed the non-existent file include
2. Fixed the function call to use the geoids submodule namespace
3. Maintained the same exports but with clearer documentation

This should resolve the `SystemError` since we're no longer trying to include a non-existent file. After restarting Julia, all geoid constants and functions should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

---

_**User**_

Are there any others that you need to make similar fixes for?

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the geoids submodule to see if there are any other functions that need to be accessed through the submodule namespace:

Yes, looking at the geoids submodule, I see that several other functions are also defined there and need to be accessed through the submodule namespace. Let me fix those:


---

```diff

+ export get_east_of_cascade_geoids 
  export get_southern_kansas_geoids 
  export get_state_gdp 
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Updated all geoid constant definitions to use the `geoids.` namespace when calling the functions
2. Added comments to indicate which functions are from the geoids submodule in the exports section
3. Removed duplicate comments for functions that are already marked as being from the geoids submodule

The key changes are:
1. All geoid-related function calls now use the `geoids.` namespace
2. All geoid-related functions are properly marked in the exports section
3. Maintained the same exports but with clearer documentation

This should resolve any remaining namespace issues with the geoid functions. After restarting Julia, all geoid constants and functions should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

The only file with the string geoids to be imported as geoids.jl; all functions with the string geoids are in there and need to be exported as part of the submodule namespace 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. All the geoid-related functions are already defined in the geoids submodule, so we don't need to include them again. Let me fix this by removing those includes and updating the exports:

I've made the following changes:

1. Removed all the duplicate includes of geoid-related functions since they're already defined in the geoids submodule
2. Changed the constant definitions to use the pre-computed values from the geoids submodule instead of calling the functions
3. Removed the exports of geoid-related functions since they're already exported by the geoids submodule
4. Kept the exports of the geoid constants since they're redefined in the main module

The key changes are:
1. No more duplicate includes of geoid functions
2. Using pre-computed constants from the geoids submodule
3. Removed redundant exports of geoid functions
4. Maintained the same exports of geoid constants

This should resolve the `SystemError` since we're no longer trying to include non-existent files. After restarting Julia, all geoid constants and functions should be properly defined and available through the geoids submodule.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

---

_**User**_

Here are some more export problems; fix and verify

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. Looking at the geoids submodule, some of the constants we're trying to use aren't actually defined there. Let me check the geoids submodule exports and fix this:


---

<details>

---

I see the issue now. Looking at the geoids submodule, some of the constants we're trying to use aren't pre-computed there. Let me fix this by updating the Census.jl file to only use the constants that are actually defined in the geoids submodule:


---

```diff
  const southern_kansas_geoids = geoids.southern_kansas_geoids
  const colorado_basin_geoids = geoids.colorado_basin_geoids
- const ne_missouri_geoids = geoids.ne_missouri_geoids
- const southern_missouri_geoids = geoids.southern_missouri_geoids
- const northern_missouri_geoids = geoids.northern_missouri_geoids
- const missouri_river_basin_geoids = geoids.missouri_river_basin_geoids
+ 
+ # Define Missouri-related geoid constants using the geoids submodule functions
+ const ne_missouri_geoids = geoids.get_ne_missouri_geoids()
+ const southern_missouri_geoids = geoids.get_southern_missouri_geoids()
+ const northern_missouri_geoids = geoids.get_northern_missouri_geoids()
+ const missouri_river_basin_geoids = geoids.get_missouri_river_basin_geoids()
  
  # Export all public functions and constants
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Split the geoid constants into two groups:
   - Pre-computed constants from the geoids submodule (western_geoids, eastern_geoids, etc.)
   - Missouri-related constants that need to be computed using the geoids submodule functions
2. Updated the Missouri-related constants to use the function calls instead of trying to access non-existent pre-computed constants

The key changes are:
1. Using `geoids.western_geoids` etc. for pre-computed constants
2. Using `geoids.get_ne_missouri_geoids()` etc. for Missouri-related constants
3. Maintained the same exports but with proper function calls

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since we're now using the correct way to access the geoid functions and constants. After restarting Julia, all geoid constants and functions should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

_**User**_

This is in the parent module Census. How do we make get_geo_pop available here?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The `get_geo_pop` function is being used in the geoids submodule but it's not available there. We need to make it available to the geoids submodule. Let me fix this:


---

```diff
  using DataFrames
  using ArchGDAL
+ 
+ # Import get_geo_pop from parent module
+ import ..Census: get_geo_pop
  
  # Database connection parameters
```

---

Now we need to make sure `get_geo_pop` is defined before the geoids submodule tries to use it. Let's move the include of `get_geo_pop.jl` before the geoids submodule:


---

```diff
  using URIs
  using Franklin
- 
- # Include the geoids submodule (which includes its implementation)
- include("geoids/geoids.jl")
  
  # Include files in dependency order
  include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "methods.jl"))  # Method definitions
  include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "highlighters.jl"))  # Syntax highlighting
+ 
+ # Include get_geo_pop before geoids submodule since it's needed there
+ include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_geo_pop.jl"))
+ 
+ # Include the geoids submodule (which includes its implementation)
+ include("geoids/geoids.jl")
  
  # Include all other function files
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_childbearing_population.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_dem_vote.jl"))
- include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_geo_pop.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_gop_vote.jl"))
  include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "get_nation_state.jl"))
```

---

I've made two key changes:

1. Added `import ..Census: get_geo_pop` to the geoids submodule to import the function from the parent module
2. Moved the include of `get_geo_pop.jl` before the geoids submodule include to ensure the function is defined before it's needed

The key changes are:
1. The geoids submodule now explicitly imports `get_geo_pop` from the parent module
2. The function is loaded before the submodule that needs it
3. Removed the duplicate include of `get_geo_pop.jl` from its original location

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since `get_geo_pop` will now be available when the geoids submodule needs it. After restarting Julia, all functions should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

Ah, I see the issue. The `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids` function is being exported in the geoids submodule but it's not actually defined anywhere. Let me check the implementation:

I see the issue. The `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids` function is being exported in the geoids submodule but it's not actually defined anywhere. Let me add the function to `src/geoids/impl.jl`:


---

```diff
  # Define static geoid sets
  const east_of_sierras_geoids = ["06049", "06035", "06051", "06027"]

+     # minus those that don't drain into the Missouri
+     return setdiff(all_mo, mississippi_counties, non_missouri_counties)
+ end
  
```

---

I've added the `get_missouri_river_basin_geoids` function to `src/geoids/impl.jl`. The function:

1. Gets all Missouri counties using `get_geo_pop`
2. Gets counties that drain into the Mississippi using `get_ne_missouri_geoids`
3. Gets counties that don't drain into the Missouri using `get_southern_missouri_geoids`
4. Returns the set difference of all Missouri counties minus those that drain into the Mississippi and those that don't drain into the Missouri

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since the function is now properly defined. After restarting Julia, all geoid functions and constants should be properly defined and available.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

_**User**_

find how where this when missing, get_crs isn't there either

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I see that `CRS_STRINGS` and `get_crs` are defined in `src/geoids/crs.jl` but they're not being properly exported through the module hierarchy. Let me fix this:

1. First, let's check if `crs.jl` is being included in the geoids submodule:

I see the issue. While `crs.jl` is included in the geoids submodule, we need to add `CRS_STRINGS` and `get_crs` to the exports in the geoids submodule. Let me fix this:

Now we need to make sure these are also exported from the main Census module. Let me update the main module's exports:



---

```diff
  export install_r_packages  # Add install_r_packages to exports
  export LibPQ  # Add LibPQ to exports
+ export get_crs  # Add get_crs to exports
+ export CRS_STRINGS  # Add CRS_STRINGS to exports
  
  # Export all geoid constants
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Added `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` to the exports in the geoids submodule
2. Added `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` to the exports in the main Census module

The key changes are:
1. Both functions/constants are now properly exported from the geoids submodule
2. Both functions/constants are now properly exported from the main Census module
3. The exports are properly organized in their respective sections

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since both `CRS_STRINGS` and `get_crs` will now be available after `using Census`. After restarting Julia, you should be able to access both `CRS_STRINGS` and `get_crs` directly.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

Ah, I see the issue. We need to re-export the functions from the geoids submodule in the main Census module. Let me fix this:


---

```diff
  # Include the geoids submodule (which includes its implementation)
  include("geoids/geoids.jl")
+ 
+ # Re-export geoids submodule functions and constants
+ using .geoids: get_crs, CRS_STRINGS
  
  # Include all other function files
  export install_r_packages  # Add install_r_packages to exports
  export LibPQ  # Add LibPQ to exports
- export get_crs  # Add get_crs to exports
- export CRS_STRINGS  # Add CRS_STRINGS to exports
  
  # Export all geoid constants
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Added `using .geoids: get_crs, CRS_STRINGS` to import the functions from the geoids submodule
2. Removed the redundant exports of `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` since they're now properly imported from the submodule

The key changes are:
1. We now properly import the functions from the geoids submodule using `using .geoids:`
2. The functions are automatically re-exported since we're using `using` instead of `import`
3. Removed redundant exports that were trying to export undefined functions

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` will now be properly imported from the geoids submodule and re-exported by the main module. After restarting Julia, you should be able to access both `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` directly.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?

Let me check the order of operations. The issue might be that we're trying to use `get_crs` before it's fully defined. Let's try moving the geoids submodule include and its re-exports to the top of the file, right after the dependencies:



---

```diff
  using URIs
  using Franklin
- 
- # Include files in dependency order
- include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "cons.jl"))  # Constants and basic definitions
- include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "dict.jl"))  # Dictionary definitions
- include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "stru.jl"))  # Structure definitions
- include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "methods.jl"))  # Method definitions
- include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "highlighters.jl"))  # Syntax highlighting
  
  # Include get_geo_pop before geoids submodule since it's needed there
  # Re-export geoids submodule functions and constants
  using .geoids: get_crs, CRS_STRINGS
+ 
+ # Include files in dependency order
+ include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "cons.jl"))  # Constants and basic definitions
+ include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "dict.jl"))  # Dictionary definitions
+ include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "stru.jl"))  # Structure definitions
+ include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "methods.jl"))  # Method definitions
+ include(joinpath(dirname(@__DIR__), "scripts", "highlighters.jl"))  # Syntax highlighting
  
  # Include all other function files
```

Let me also check the geoids submodule to make sure it's properly exporting `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS`:


---



---

Let me check the crs.jl file to make sure it's properly exporting its functions:


---



---

Let me try a different approach. Instead of using `using .geoids:`, let's try importing and re-exporting explicitly:



---

```diff
  include("geoids/geoids.jl")
  
- # Re-export geoids submodule functions and constants
- using .geoids: get_crs, CRS_STRINGS
+ # Import and re-export geoids submodule functions and constants
+ import .geoids: get_crs, CRS_STRINGS
+ export get_crs, CRS_STRINGS
  
  # Include files in dependency order
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Changed from `using .geoids:` to `import .geoids:` to be more explicit about importing
2. Added explicit `export` statements for `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS`
3. Kept the geoids submodule include at the top of the file

The key changes are:
1. More explicit import and export of the functions
2. Maintaining the same order of operations
3. Ensuring the functions are properly re-exported from the main module

This should resolve the `UndefVarError` since we're now being more explicit about importing and re-exporting the functions. After restarting Julia, you should be able to access both `get_crs` and `CRS_STRINGS` directly.

Would you like me to verify any specific exports or make any other adjustments?
