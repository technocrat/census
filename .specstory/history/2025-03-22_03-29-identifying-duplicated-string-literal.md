# Identifying Duplicated String Literal (2025-03-21 20:29:00)

find the juxtaposed string literal

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I can see that in `ar_basin_mo`, there is a duplicated FIPS code `"29067"` that appears twice in the array:

```julia:scripts/cons.jl
ar_basin_mo   = ["29011","29145","29119","29109","29009",
                 "29077","29043","29209","29113","29067",  # First occurrence
                 "29227","29067","29153","29091","29149",  # Second occurrence
                 "29181","29023"]
```

The FIPS code `"29067"` appears on both line 156 and line 157 of the file. This appears to be a potential error where the same county code was accidentally included twice in the array.

But that is not what is giving the juxtaposed string literal error

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking through the code again, I notice that in `take_from_metro`, there are several instances of juxtaposed string literals where the same FIPS code appears multiple times in sequence:

```julia:scripts/cons.jl
take_from_metro = ["24003", "24001", "24023", "36003", "36009", "36011", 
                   "36013", "36014", "36015", "36019", "36019", "36029",  # "36019", "36019"
                   "36031", "36031", "36033", "36037", "36037", "36037",  # "36031", "36031" and "36037", "36037", "36037"
                   // ... rest of array
                   "51084", "51084", // another instance
                   // ... rest of array
                   "54001", "54001" // another instance
                   // ... rest of array
```

These are cases where string literals are directly next to each other with the same value, which would trigger a juxtaposed string literal warning. The most prominent examples are:
- `"36019", "36019"`
- `"36031", "36031"`
- `"36037", "36037", "36037"`
- `"51084", "51084"`
- `"54001", "54001"`

Bullshit. The metro_to_gl with the three repeated, comma separated "36037" strings doesn't throw the error

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for my incorrect assumptions. You're absolutely right - comma-separated repeated values don't trigger the juxtaposed string literal error.

Looking at the code again, I notice in `gl_oh` there's a potential issue:

```julia:scripts/cons.jl
gl_oh 		  = ["39055","39085","39035","39103","39093","39043",
                 "39077","39033","39147","39143","39123","39095",
                 "39173","39063","39007","39003","39137","39065",
                 "39051","39171","39069","39161","39039","39125",
                 "39175","39173","37199"]  # Notice "39173" appears twice
```

But even this isn't a juxtaposed string literal error since they're comma-separated.

Could you point me to where exactly you're seeing the error? I may be missing something obvious.

_**User**_

The only string vector I'm having trouble with is ma_basin_mo at lines 155-158

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Looking at `ar_basin_mo` (not `ma_basin_mo`), I don't see any juxtaposed string literals in the current version:

```julia:scripts/cons.jl
ar_basin_mo   = ["29011","29145","29119","29109","29009",
                 "29077","29043","29209","29113","29067",
                 "29227","29023","29153","29091","29149",
                 "29181"]
```

All the strings are properly comma-separated. If you're getting a juxtaposed string literal error, it might be in a different version of the file than what I'm seeing. Could you share the exact error message you're getting? That would help me identify the issue more precisely.

What could be causing the filter to fail to detect the string "45229"

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your data, I notice a discrepancy between the FIPS codes:

In your DataFrame `b`, you have:
```
geoid: "48229"  # starts with 48
```

But in `rio_basin_tx`, you have:
```julia
rio_basin_tx = [
    "45141",    # starts with 45
    "45229"     # starts with 45
]
```

The issue is that Texas FIPS codes should start with "48" (48 is Texas's state FIPS code), not "45" (which is South Carolina's state code). That's why the filter isn't finding any matches - you're looking for "45229" but the actual Texas county code would be "48229".

You should update `rio_basin_tx` to use the correct Texas FIPS prefix of "48" instead of "45".
