# Fixing Syntax Error in Julia Script (2025-03-26 20:57:49)

_**User**_

find it

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice there's a syntax error in the `adj_concord.jl` script. The error is in the `GeoAxis` constructor where there's an incomplete `dest` parameter. Let me fix this.

I'll edit the file to correct the syntax error:


---

```diff
      gl[2, 1],  # Use the grid layout
      source="+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84",
-     dest=,
      title="Population",
      xlabel="",
```

---

I've removed the incomplete `dest=` parameter that was causing the syntax error. The `GeoAxis` constructor should now work correctly. The error was simply a trailing comma after an incomplete parameter assignment. The script should now run without this syntax error.

Would you like me to help you with anything else in the script?

---

_**User**_

I don't understand why changes in the map_colors constant aren't being reflected in the plot colors

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you understand and fix this issue. First, I'll check if `map_colors` is defined in your code.

Let me check the definition of `map_colors` in the cons.jl file:


---

Read file: scripts/cons.jl

---

I see the issue now. There are a few potential reasons why changes to `map_colors` aren't being reflected:

1. The `map_colors` is defined as a `const` in `cons.jl`, which means it's evaluated at compile time. If you're modifying it in the REPL or in a running session, those changes won't take effect until you restart Julia.

2. The colors are being used with `colormap=map_colors` in the `poly!` function, but we need to make sure the number of colors matches the number of bins in your data.

Let me check how the bins are being created:


---

Read file: scripts/adj_concord.jl

---

I see that you're creating 5 bins (`get_breaks(df,5)`), but looking at the `map_colors` definition, it seems to have fewer colors defined.

Here's what you need to do to fix this:

1. First, make sure you have enough colors in `map_colors` for all your bins. You need at least 5 colors since you're using 5 bins.

2. If you want to modify the colors, you'll need to:
   - Either modify the `cons.jl` file and restart Julia
   - Or define a new color array in your script that overrides the constant

Here's how you can modify your script to use custom colors without changing `cons.jl`:


---

```diff
  # Create figure
  fig = Figure(size=(2400, 1600), fontsize=22)
+ 
+ # Define custom colors for the 5 bins
+ custom_colors = [
+     RGB(0.196, 0.388, 0.075),  # Forest Green
+     RGB(0.282, 0.416, 0.698),  # Bright Blue
+     RGB(0.812, 0.812, 0.812),  # Light Gray
+     RGB(0.847, 0.749, 0.847),  # Vie en Rose
+     RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)         # Medium Gray
+ ]
  
  # Create the GeoAxis in the second row
                  poly_obj,
                  color=df[i, :pop_bins],
-                 colormap=map_colors,
+                 colormap=custom_colors,
                  strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
                  strokewidth=1
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Added a `custom_colors` array with 5 distinct colors (matching your 5 bins)
2. Changed the `colormap` parameter to use `custom_colors` instead of `map_colors`

Now you can:
1. Modify the colors in the `custom_colors` array directly in your script
2. The changes will be reflected immediately when you run the script
3. You have exactly 5 colors to match your 5 bins

You can adjust the RGB values in the `custom_colors` array to get exactly the colors you want. Each color is defined as an RGB tuple with values between 0 and 1. For example, if you want a brighter blue, you could increase the blue component (the third number) in the second color.

Would you like me to help you adjust the colors to specific values you prefer?

---

_**User**_

Nothing changed

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you debug this. First, let's check what values are actually in your `pop_bins` to make sure they're being assigned correctly:


---

```diff
  breaks      = RCall.rcopy(get_breaks(df,5))
  df.pop_bins = my_cut(df.pop, breaks[:kmeans][:brks])
+ 
+ # Print diagnostic information
+ println("Unique pop_bins categories:")
+ println(unique(df.pop_bins))
+ println("\nNumber of categories: ", length(unique(df.pop_bins)))
  
  # Convert WKT strings to geometric objects
```

---

Let me also check how the `my_cut` function is implemented to understand how it's creating the bins:


---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "function my_cut" • **3** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/ro/projects/census/src/my_cut.jl` | L16 | `function my_cut(x, breaks)` |
| `file:///Users/ro/projects/census/__site/src/my_cut.jl` | L16 | `function my_cut(x, breaks)` |
| `file:///Users/ro/projects/census/__site/scripts/my_cut.jl` | L16 | `function my_cut(x, breaks)` |

</details>

---

Let me check the implementation:


---

Read file: src/my_cut.jl

---

Now I understand the issue. The problem is that `my_cut` returns numeric indices (1, 2, 3, etc.) rather than categorical values. When we use these with `colormap`, we need to make sure the colors are being applied correctly to these numeric indices.

Let's modify the plotting code to handle this:



---

```diff
                  color=df[i, :pop_bins],
                  colormap=custom_colors,
+                 colorrange=(1, 5),  # Explicitly set the color range to match our 5 bins
                  strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
                  strokewidth=1
```

---

I've added the `colorrange=(1, 5)` parameter to explicitly tell Makie how to map the numeric bin indices to the colors. This should now properly map:
- Bin 1 to the first color (Forest Green)
- Bin 2 to the second color (Bright Blue)
- Bin 3 to the third color (Light Gray)
- Bin 4 to the fourth color (Vie en Rose)
- Bin 5 to the fifth color (Medium Gray)

Try running the script again. The colors should now be properly applied based on the population bins. If you want to change the colors, you can modify the RGB values in the `custom_colors` array. For example, if you want a different color for the highest population bin, you can change the last color in the array.

Let me know if you still don't see the changes, and we can try other approaches to debug this.

---

_**User**_

That made no difference

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try a different approach. First, let's check what values we're actually getting in the bins and how they're being used. I'll modify the code to print more diagnostic information:



---

```diff
  df.pop_bins = my_cut(df.pop, breaks[:kmeans][:brks])
  
- # Print diagnostic information
- println("Unique pop_bins categories:")
+ # Print detailed diagnostic information
+ println("\nBreak points:")
+ println(breaks[:kmeans][:brks])
+ println("\nPopulation values:")
+ println(df.pop)
+ println("\nBin assignments:")
+ println(df.pop_bins)
+ println("\nUnique bins:")
  println(unique(df.pop_bins))
- println("\nNumber of categories: ", length(unique(df.pop_bins)))
+ println("\nBin counts:")
+ for bin in sort(unique(df.pop_bins))
+     println("Bin $bin: ", count(x -> x == bin, df.pop_bins))
+ end
  
  # Convert WKT strings to geometric objects
```

---

Let's also try a different approach to the coloring. Instead of using `colormap`, let's create a direct mapping from bin numbers to colors:



---

```diff
      RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)         # Medium Gray
  ]
+ 
+ # Create bin to color mapping
+ bin_to_color = Dict(i => custom_colors[i] for i in 1:5)
  
  # Create the GeoAxis in the second row
                  ga1,
                  poly_obj,
-                 color=df[i, :pop_bins],
-                 colormap=custom_colors,
-                 colorrange=(1, 5),  # Explicitly set the color range to match our 5 bins
+                 color=bin_to_color[df[i, :pop_bins]],  # Use direct color mapping
                  strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
                  strokewidth=1
```

---

I've made two major changes:

1. Added detailed diagnostic printing so we can see exactly what values we're working with
2. Changed the coloring approach to use a direct mapping from bin numbers to colors instead of using `colormap`

This should help us understand what's happening with the data and potentially fix the coloring issue. When you run this version, we'll be able to see:
- The actual break points being used
- The population values
- How those values are being assigned to bins
- The distribution of values across bins

This information will help us understand if there's an issue with the binning process or with how the colors are being applied. Please run this version and share the diagnostic output so we can see what's happening with the data.

Let me check the `cons.jl` file to see the global `map_colors` definition:



---

Read file: scripts/cons.jl

---

Now I see the issue. The `map_colors` constant is being loaded from `cons.jl` and it's being used globally. Let's try to override it by modifying our script to use a different approach:



---

```diff
  fig = Figure(size=(2400, 1600), fontsize=22)
  
- # Define custom colors for the 5 bins
+ # Define custom colors for the 5 bins using Makie's built-in colors
  custom_colors = [
-     RGB(0.196, 0.388, 0.075),  # Forest Green
-     RGB(0.282, 0.416, 0.698),  # Bright Blue
-     RGB(0.812, 0.812, 0.812),  # Light Gray
-     RGB(0.847, 0.749, 0.847),  # Vie en Rose
-     RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)         # Medium Gray
+     :forestgreen,  # Forest Green
+     :royalblue,    # Royal Blue
+     :lightgray,    # Light Gray
+     :pink,         # Pink
+     :gray          # Gray
  ]
- 
- # Create bin to color mapping
- bin_to_color = Dict(i => custom_colors[i] for i in 1:5)
  
  # Create the GeoAxis in the second row
                  ga1,
                  poly_obj,
-                 color=bin_to_color[df[i, :pop_bins]],  # Use direct color mapping
+                 color=custom_colors[df[i, :pop_bins]],  # Use Makie's built-in colors
                  strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
                  strokewidth=1
```

---

I've made several changes:

1. Instead of using RGB values, I'm now using Makie's built-in color symbols (`:forestgreen`, `:royalblue`, etc.)
2. Removed the dictionary mapping and directly using the color array indexing
3. Using simpler, more distinct colors that should be clearly visible

This approach should bypass any global color settings and use Makie's built-in color system directly. The colors should now be:
- Forest Green for the lowest population bin
- Royal Blue for the second bin
- Light Gray for the third bin
- Pink for the fourth bin
- Gray for the highest population bin

Try running this version. If it still doesn't work, we might need to:
1. Check if there's a global theme setting affecting the colors
2. Try using a different plotting approach altogether
3. Look at how the `add_labels!` function might be affecting the plot

Let me know if you still see the same colors as before.

---

_**User**_

It is still the same

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the `add_labels!` function since it might be affecting the plot. Let me search for it:

---

Let me check its implementation:



---

Read file: src/add_labels.jl

---

Ah! I found the issue. The `add_labels!` function is calling `map_poly(df, the_axis, "pop")` which is likely overriding our color settings. Let me check the `map_poly` function:


---

</details>

---

Let me check its implementation:



---

Read file: src/map_poly.jl

---

Now I see exactly what's happening! The `add_labels!` function is calling `map_poly` which is using the global `map_colors` from `cons.jl`. Let's modify our script to avoid this double-plotting:



---

```diff
  end
  
- # Add labels
- add_labels!(df, ga1, :county, fontsize=12)
+ # Add labels manually
+ for i in 1:nrow(df)
+     geom = df.geom[i]
+     multi_poly = geom isa String ? ArchGDAL.fromWKT(geom) : geom
+     centroid = ArchGDAL.centroid(multi_poly)
+     x = Float64(ArchGDAL.getx(centroid, 0))
+     y = Float64(ArchGDAL.gety(centroid, 0))
+     text!(
+         ga1,
+         x,
+         y,
+         0.0,
+         text=string(df[i, :county]),
+         fontsize=12,
+         color=:black
+     )
+ end
  
  # Display the figure
```

---

I've made a significant change to the script:

1. Removed the `add_labels!` function call which was causing the double-plotting issue
2. Implemented our own label-adding code that doesn't use `map_poly`
3. Kept our custom colors for the polygons

Now the script should:
1. Plot the polygons with our custom colors (forest green, royal blue, light gray, pink, and gray)
2. Add the county labels without re-plotting the polygons

This should finally show the colors we want. The previous issue was that `add_labels!` was calling `map_poly` which was re-plotting everything with the global `map_colors` from `cons.jl`, effectively overwriting our custom colors.

Try running this version - you should now see the different colors for different population bins. Let me know if you still see the same colors as before.

That results in only two polygons getting colored—Lincoln and Chittenden counties

Let me check the diagnostic output we added earlier to understand what's happening with the bin assignments. Could you share what was printed for:
1. Break points
2. Population values
3. Bin assignments
4. Unique bins
5. Bin counts

This will help us understand why only two counties are getting colored. In the meantime, let me try a different approach to the coloring:



---

```diff
      println("Bin $bin: ", count(x -> x == bin, df.pop_bins))
  end
+ 
+ # Print more diagnostic information
+ println("\nCounty names and their bins:")
+ for i in 1:nrow(df)
+     println("$(df[i, :county]): bin $(df[i, :pop_bins])")
+ end
  
  # Convert WKT strings to geometric objects
      multi_poly = geom
      n_polys = ArchGDAL.ngeom(multi_poly)
+     
+     # Get the bin number and ensure it's valid
+     bin_num = df[i, :pop_bins]
+     println("Processing $(df[i, :county]): bin $bin_num")
      
      for p_idx in 0:(n_polys-1)
          if !isempty(point_list)
              poly_obj = GeometryBasics.Polygon(point_list)
+             # Ensure bin_num is within valid range
+             color_idx = min(max(1, bin_num), length(custom_colors))
              poly!(
                  ga1,
                  poly_obj,
-                 color=custom_colors[df[i, :pop_bins]],  # Use Makie's built-in colors
+                 color=custom_colors[color_idx],
                  strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
                  strokewidth=1
```

I've added more diagnostic printing and made the color selection more robust. This will help us understand:
1. Which counties are assigned to which bins
2. The exact bin numbers being used
3. Whether the bin numbers are valid for our color array

Could you run this version and share the diagnostic output? This will help us understand why only two counties are getting colored. The issue might be:
1. The bin numbers are not what we expect
2. The binning process isn't working correctly
3. There might be an issue with the data filtering

Once we see the diagnostic output, we can fix the root cause of the problem.

_**User**_

We got a couple of array size issues

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, I see the errors now:
1. `KeyError: key 6 not found` - This means we have a bin number of 6 but only 5 colors
2. `BoundsError: attempt to access 5-element Vector{Symbol} at index [6]` - Same issue with the symbol array

Let's fix this by checking the bin numbers and adjusting our color array accordingly. First, let's check what bin numbers we actually have:


---

```diff
  fig = Figure(size=(2400, 1600), fontsize=22)
  
- # Define custom colors for the 5 bins using Makie's built-in colors
+ # Print diagnostic information about bins
+ println("\nMaximum bin number: ", maximum(df.pop_bins))
+ println("Minimum bin number: ", minimum(df.pop_bins))
+ println("Unique bin numbers: ", sort(unique(df.pop_bins)))
+ 
+ # Define custom colors for all possible bins using Makie's built-in colors
  custom_colors = [
-     :forestgreen,  # Forest Green
-     :royalblue,    # Royal Blue
-     :lightgray,    # Light Gray
-     :pink,         # Pink
-     :gray          # Gray
+     :forestgreen,  # Bin 1
+     :royalblue,    # Bin 2
+     :lightgray,    # Bin 3
+     :pink,         # Bin 4
+     :gray,         # Bin 5
+     :red,          # Bin 6 (if needed)
+     :orange,       # Bin 7 (if needed)
+     :yellow        # Bin 8 (if needed)
  ]
  
```

---

I've made two key changes:

1. Added diagnostic printing to show us exactly what bin numbers we have in the data
2. Expanded the color array to handle up to 8 bins (just in case)

The error we were seeing suggests that we have a bin number of 6 in our data, but we were only providing 5 colors. This expanded color array should handle that case.

When you run this version, we'll see:
1. The maximum and minimum bin numbers
2. All unique bin numbers
3. Which counties are assigned to which bins

This will help us understand if we need to adjust the binning process or if we need to modify our color scheme further. Let me know what the diagnostic output shows and if you still see any errors.

fix syntax

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the syntax error in `map_poly.jl`. There's a missing `end` for the `for` loop and some indentation issues. Let me fix that:



---

```diff
  
      # Create the GeoAxis in the second row
-     ga1 = ga(dest,1,1,$title,fig)   
+     ga1 = ga(dest,1,1,title,fig)   
  
      # Plot the polygons
                  end
              end
-         
-         if !isempty(point_list)
-             poly_obj = GeometryBasics.Polygon(point_list)
-             # Ensure bin_num is within valid range
-             color_idx = min(max(1, bin_num), length(custom_colors))
-             poly!(
-                 ga1,
-                 poly_obj,
-                 color=custom_colors[color_idx],
-                 strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
-                 strokewidth=1
-             )
+             
+             if !isempty(point_list)
+                 poly_obj = GeometryBasics.Polygon(point_list)
+                 # Ensure bin_num is within valid range
+                 color_idx = min(max(1, bin_num), length(custom_colors))
+                 poly!(
+                     ga1,
+                     poly_obj,
+                     color=custom_colors[color_idx],
+                     strokecolor=(:black, 0.5),
+                     strokewidth=1
+                 )
+             end
          end
      end
  
- # Add labels manually
+     # Add labels manually
      for i in 1:nrow(df)
          geom = df.geom[i]
```

---

I've fixed several syntax issues:
1. Removed the `$` from `$title` in the `ga` call (string interpolation not needed here)
2. Fixed the indentation of the polygon plotting code to be inside the `p_idx` loop
3. Fixed the indentation of the labels section to be at the correct level
4. Properly closed all loops and blocks

The main issue was that the polygon plotting code was outside its proper loop scope. Now it should work correctly. Try running your script again with these fixes.

_**User**_

What did I break here?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The error `MethodError: no method matching ngeom(::String)` means we're trying to call `ArchGDAL.ngeom()` on a string instead of a geometry object. This is happening because we're not using the parsed geometries from `df.parsed_geoms`.

Let me fix that:


---

```diff
      # Plot the polygons
      for i in 1:nrow(df)
-         geom = df.geom[i]
+         geom = df.parsed_geoms[i]
          multi_poly = geom
          n_polys = ArchGDAL.ngeom(multi_poly)
      # Add labels manually
      for i in 1:nrow(df)
-         geom = df.geom[i]
-         multi_poly = geom isa String ? ArchGDAL.fromWKT(geom) : geom
+         geom = df.parsed_geoms[i]
+         multi_poly = geom
          centroid = ArchGDAL.centroid(multi_poly)
          x = Float64(ArchGDAL.getx(centroid, 0))
```

---

I've made two key changes:
1. Changed `df.geom[i]` to `df.parsed_geoms[i]` in the polygon plotting section
2. Changed the label section to also use `df.parsed_geoms[i]` and removed the string check since we know we're using parsed geometries

The error occurred because we were trying to use the raw geometry strings from `df.geom` instead of the parsed geometry objects in `df.parsed_geoms`. The parsed geometries are already converted to ArchGDAL objects that can be used with functions like `ngeom`.

Try running your script again - it should work now.
