# Exporting Constants in Uppercase (2025-04-04 00:38:26)

_**User**_

I need these as explicit exported constants in UPPERCASE

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create and export these constants from the Census module. Based on the code snippets shown, I'll create constants for the Ohio Basin and Mississippi East Louisiana geoids.

Let me first search for the relevant module file where we should add these constants.

Let me check the current content of the constants file:

---

Read file: /Users/ro/projects/census/src/constants.jl

---

I'll now add the new constants to the file. I'll create them in UPPERCASE format and add appropriate documentation.

I've added all the constants in UPPERCASE format with appropriate documentation strings. Each constant is:
1. Named in UPPERCASE with _GEOIDS suffix
2. Documented with a clear description
3. Properly formatted with consistent indentation
4. Preserves the exact GEOID values from the source

A few notes about the data:
1. There appear to be some duplicate GEOIDs in the VA list ("51750", "51640", "51520", "51720" appear twice)
2. There's a duplicate GEOID in the NC list ("37089" appears twice)
3. There's a duplicate GEOID in the GA list ("13111" appears twice)
4. There are duplicate GEOIDs in the LA list ("22051" and "22093" appear twice)

Would you like me to clean up these duplicates, or would you prefer to keep them as they are in the source data?

---

_**User**_

Clean, please

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll clean up the duplicate GEOIDs in each constant. I'll edit the file to remove the duplicates while maintaining the proper formatting.

---

_**User**_

first time i've seen this

---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like the `OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS` constant is being used in the `scripts/adj_factor.jl` file to filter out certain GEOIDs from a dataset. This is consistent with the recent changes we made to ensure these constants are exported and available for use with `using Census`.

If this is the first time you're seeing this usage, it might be because the script was updated to utilize the newly exported constants. This allows for more modular and maintainable code, as the constants are now centralized in the `Census` module.

If you have any questions about how these constants are being used or if you need further clarification on their purpose, feel free to ask!

---

_**User**_

fix

---

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to the `subset` function expecting a vector of boolean values, rather than a single boolean value, to determine which rows to keep. The function you provided to `subset` is returning a single boolean value instead of a vector.

To fix this, you can modify the function to return a vector of boolean values, indicating which rows should be kept. Here's how you can adjust the code:

```julia
al = subset(al, :geoid => x -> .!in.(x, Ref(OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS)))
```

This change uses the `in` function with broadcasting (`in.(...)`) to check each element of the `:geoid` column against the `OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS` constant, and `.!` to negate the result, effectively filtering out the GEOIDs in `OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS`. The `Ref` is used to treat `OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS` as a single argument for broadcasting.

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like me to make this change directly in your script!

---

_**User**_

Why does this work and the other fail?

---

_**Assistant**_

The difference between the two approaches lies in how the `subset` function is being used with the `ByRow` wrapper and the expected input for the function.

### Working Code:
```julia
al = subset(al, :geoid => ByRow(x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS))
```

### Failing Code:
```julia
al = subset(al, :geoid => x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Working Code with `ByRow`:**
   - The `ByRow` wrapper is used to apply the function to each element of the `:geoid` column individually.
   - `ByRow(x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS)` ensures that the function is applied to each row, returning a boolean vector indicating which rows to keep.
   - This is the correct usage when you want to apply a function to each element of a column in a DataFrame.

2. **Failing Code without `ByRow`:**
   - The function `x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS` is expected to operate on the entire column vector, not on individual elements.
   - This results in a single boolean value rather than a vector of booleans, which is not what `subset` expects.
   - `subset` requires a vector of booleans to determine which rows to keep, so the function must return a boolean for each row.

### Conclusion:
The `ByRow` wrapper is necessary when you want to apply a function to each element of a column individually. Without it, the function is applied to the entire column, which leads to incorrect behavior in this context.

---

_**User**_

This works, right?


---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, this line of code should work correctly:

```julia
df = subset(df, :geoid => ByRow(x -> x ∈ SOCAL_GEOIDS))
```

### Explanation:

- **`ByRow` Usage:** The `ByRow` wrapper is used to apply the function to each element of the `:geoid` column individually.
- **Function Logic:** The function `x -> x ∈ SOCAL_GEOIDS` checks if each `geoid` in the column is a member of the `SOCAL_GEOIDS` set.
- **Result:** This will return a boolean vector indicating which rows have `geoid` values that are in `SOCAL_GEOIDS`. The `subset` function then uses this vector to filter the DataFrame, keeping only the rows where the condition is true.

This approach is correct for filtering rows based on whether their `geoid` values are in the specified set of `SOCAL_GEOIDS`.

---

_**User**_

Why doesn't this work then?

---

_**Assistant**_

The issue with the lines you provided is the incorrect placement of the `ByRow` wrapper. The `ByRow` wrapper should be applied directly to the function that operates on each element, not wrapped inside another function. Here's the problematic code:

```julia
al = subset(al, :geoid => x -> ByRow(x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS))
al = subset(al, :geoid => x -> ByRow(x -> x ∈ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS))
```

### Explanation:

- **Incorrect Usage of `ByRow`:** The `ByRow` wrapper is being used inside another function (`x -> ...`), which is not how it is intended to be used. `ByRow` should directly wrap the function that is applied to each element.
- **Expected Usage:** The `subset` function expects a function that returns a boolean vector, and `ByRow` is used to ensure the function is applied to each element individually.

### Correct Usage:

To fix this, you should apply `ByRow` directly to the function, like this:

```julia
al = subset(al, :geoid => ByRow(x -> x ∉ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS))
al = subset(al, :geoid => ByRow(x -> x ∈ OHIO_BASIN_AL_GEOIDS))
```

### Conclusion:

The `ByRow` wrapper should be used directly with the function that checks each element, not nested inside another function. This ensures that the function is applied to each element of the column individually, returning the correct boolean vector for filtering.

Create and export a new const OHIO_BASIN_MD with the Maryland geoids for Washington, Allegany and Garrett counties

---

_**Assistant**_

To create and export a new constant `OHIO_BASIN_MD` with the Maryland GEOIDs for Washington, Allegany, and Garrett counties, I'll follow these steps:

1. Add the new constant to the `constants.jl` file.
2. Ensure the constant is exported in the `Census.jl` module.

Let's start by adding the constant to the `constants.jl` file.

---

```diff
                            "22071","22089"]
  
+ """
+     OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS::Vector{String}
+ 
+ GEOIDs for Maryland counties in the Ohio River Basin: Washington, Allegany, and Garrett.
+ """
+ const OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS = ["24043", "24001", "24023"]
+ 
  
```

---

The new constant `OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS` has been added to the `constants.jl` file. Now, let's ensure it is exported in the `Census.jl` module so it can be accessed with `using Census`.

---

```diff
         OHIO_BASIN_VA_GEOIDS,
         OHIO_BASIN_GA_GEOIDS,

+        OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS
  
  # Export everything from the module
```

---

The `OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS` constant is now exported in the `Census.jl` module. You can access it using `using Census`. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!

Adapt this to create a new constant OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS by selecting Counties that are not west of Iroquois County

---

_**Assistant**_

To create a new constant `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` by selecting counties in Illinois that are not west of Iroquois County, we need to adapt the SQL query to select counties based on their longitude relative to Iroquois County. Here's how you can do it:

### SQL Query Adaptation

The goal is to select counties in Illinois that are not west of Iroquois County. This means we need to compare the longitude (X-coordinate) of each county's centroid to that of Iroquois County.

```sql
WITH Iroquois_lon AS (
    SELECT ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as lon 
    FROM census.counties 
    WHERE name = 'Iroquois' AND stusps = 'IL'
)
SELECT geoid
FROM census.counties c, Iroquois_lon i
WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) >= i.lon AND c.stusps = 'IL'
ORDER BY geoid;
```

### Explanation

- **Iroquois_lon CTE:** This common table expression (CTE) calculates the longitude of the centroid of Iroquois County.
- **Main Query:** It selects GEOIDs of counties in Illinois (`c.stusps = 'IL'`) where the longitude of the centroid is greater than or equal to that of Iroquois County (`ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) >= i.lon`).

### Implementation

You can execute this query using your database connection in Julia and store the result in the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant. Here's a sample implementation in Julia:

```julia
using LibPQ
using DataFrames

function get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
    conn = get_db_connection()
    query = """
    WITH Iroquois_lon AS (
        SELECT ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)) as lon 
        FROM census.counties 
        WHERE name = 'Iroquois' AND stusps = 'IL'
    )
    SELECT geoid
    FROM census.counties c, Iroquois_lon i
    WHERE ST_X(ST_Centroid(c.geom)) >= i.lon AND c.stusps = 'IL'
    ORDER BY geoid;
    """
    result = LibPQ.execute(conn, query)
    close(conn)
    return DataFrame(result).geoid
end

const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS = get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
```

### Export the Constant

Ensure that `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is exported in the `Census.jl` module to make it available with `using Census`. If you need further assistance with implementing this, let me know!

---

_**User**_

Add it to exports

---

+        OHIO_BASIN_MD_GEOIDS,
+        OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS
  
  # Export everything from the module
```

---

The `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant is now exported in the `Census.jl` module. You can access it using `using Census`. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!

---

_**User**_

I don't see it

---

_**Assistant**_

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or an issue with the definition or initialization of the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant. Let's go through a checklist to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **Definition in `constants.jl`:** Ensure that `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is defined in the `constants.jl` file. It should look something like this:
   ```julia
   const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS = get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
   ```

2. **Function Implementation:** Ensure that the `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()` function is implemented correctly and returns the expected GEOIDs.

3. **Export in `Census.jl`:** Make sure `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is included in the export list in the `Census.jl` module:
   ```julia
   export OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS
   ```

4. **Module Reload:** If you have made changes to the module, ensure that you reload it in your Julia session. You can do this by restarting the Julia REPL or using `Revise.jl` if it's set up.

5. **Check for Errors:** Look for any errors or warnings during the module loading process that might indicate issues with the function or constant definition.

If all these steps are correctly followed and you still encounter the issue, there might be a problem with how the function is executed or how the constant is initialized. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like me to check any specific part of the code!

---

_**User**_

Still not there

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's troubleshoot why `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is not being recognized. Here are some steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **Check the Definition:**
   - Ensure that `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is defined in the `constants.jl` file. It should be initialized with the function `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()`.

2. **Verify the Function:**
   - Make sure the `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()` function is implemented correctly and returns the expected GEOIDs. This function should be defined in a way that it can be called during the module's initialization.

3. **Export Statement:**
   - Confirm that `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is included in the export list in the `Census.jl` module. The export statement should look like this:
     ```julia
     export OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS
     ```

4. **Module Reload:**
   - After making changes, ensure that you reload the module in your Julia session. You can restart the Julia REPL or use `Revise.jl` to automatically track changes.

5. **Check for Errors:**
   - Look for any errors or warnings during the module loading process that might indicate issues with the function or constant definition.

6. **Precompilation:**
   - Ensure that the module is precompiled without errors. Sometimes, precompilation issues can prevent new changes from being recognized.

If all these steps are correctly followed and you still encounter the issue, there might be a problem with how the function is executed or how the constant is initialized. If you can provide more details about the `constants.jl` file and the function implementation, I can help further diagnose the issue.

Here's what I found regarding the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant:

1. **Definition:**
   - It seems like `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is defined in `scripts/erie.jl` as:
     ```julia
     const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS = get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
     ```
   - The function `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()` is defined in the same file.

2. **Export:**
   - In `src/Census.jl`, there is a line:
     ```julia
     const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOID_LIST = GreatLakes.get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
     ```
   - However, `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is not directly exported from `Census.jl`.

3. **Usage:**
   - The constant is used in `scripts/adj_factor.jl`:
     ```julia
     il = subset(il, :geoid => ByRow(x -> x ∈ OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS))
     ```

### Next Steps:

- **Ensure Export:**
  - Make sure `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` is included in the export list in `Census.jl`. It should look like this:
    ```julia
    export OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS
    ```

- **Check Initialization:**
  - Verify that `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()` is correctly implemented and returns the expected GEOIDs.

- **Module Reload:**
  - After making changes, reload the module in your Julia session.

Would you like me to make these changes directly, or is there anything specific you'd like to address?

The function shouln't be in the script, per policy. Implement it in the src directory, use it to get the list of geoids in IL, create the constant and export it

Let's implement the `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids` function in the `great_lakes.jl` file, use it to create the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant, and ensure it is exported in the `Census.jl` module.

### Steps:

1. **Implement the Function:**
   - I'll implement the `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids` function to execute the SQL query and return the GEOIDs.

2. **Create the Constant:**
   - Use the function to initialize the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant.

3. **Export the Constant:**
   - Ensure the constant is exported in the `Census.jl` module.

Let's proceed with these changes.

It seems there was an issue with exporting the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant. Let me try adding it to the export list again.

---



---

It seems there is a persistent issue with adding the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant to the export list. Let's try a different approach to ensure it is correctly exported.

I'll manually verify the export list and ensure the constant is included. Let's proceed with that.

---

Read file: /Users/ro/projects/census/src/Census.jl

---

The `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant is indeed included in the export list in the `Census.jl` module. It should be accessible when you use `using Census`.

If you're still not seeing it, here are a few things to check:

1. **Reload the Module:**
   - Ensure that you have reloaded the `Census` module in your Julia session. You can restart the Julia REPL or use `Revise.jl` to track changes automatically.

2. **Check for Errors:**
   - Look for any errors or warnings during the module loading process that might indicate issues with the function or constant definition.

3. **Verify Access:**
   - After reloading, try accessing the constant directly in your Julia session:
     ```julia
     using Census
     println(OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS)
     ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, there might be a problem with how the module is being loaded or initialized. Let me know if you need further assistance!

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue now. The problem is that we're trying to use `get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()` in `constants.jl` before it's available from the `GreatLakes` module. We need to:

1. Move the constant definition from `constants.jl` to `Census.jl` after the `GreatLakes` module is loaded
2. Remove it from `constants.jl`

Let's make these changes:

Let me try a different approach to remove the constant:

I apologize for the difficulty with the edit. Let's try one more time with a more specific edit:

```diff
  const GREAT_LAKES_OH_GEOID_LIST = GreatLakes.get_great_lakes_oh_geoids()
  const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOID_LIST = GreatLakes.get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()

+ # Initialize Illinois Ohio Basin GEOIDs after GreatLakes module is loaded
+ const OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS = GreatLakes.get_ohio_basin_il_geoids()
  
  # Export all geoid constants
```

Now let's remove the constant from `constants.jl`:

The changes have been made:

1. Removed the `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` constant from `constants.jl`
2. Added the initialization of `OHIO_BASIN_IL_GEOIDS` in `Census.jl` after the `GreatLakes` module is loaded
3. The constant is already in the export list in `Census.jl`

These changes should resolve the `UndefVarError` since we're now initializing the constant after the `GreatLakes` module is loaded and its functions are available. The constant will still be exported and available when using `using Census`.
