# Exporting Constants in Uppercase (2025-04-04 00:38:26)

_**User**_

I need these as explicit exported constants in UPPERCASE

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create and export these constants from the Census module. Based on the code snippets shown, I'll create constants for the Ohio Basin and Mississippi East Louisiana geoids.

Let me first search for the relevant module file where we should add these constants.

Let me check the current content of the constants file:

---

Read file: /Users/ro/projects/census/src/constants.jl

---

I'll now add the new constants to the file. I'll create them in UPPERCASE format and add appropriate documentation.

I've added all the constants in UPPERCASE format with appropriate documentation strings. Each constant is:
1. Named in UPPERCASE with _GEOIDS suffix
2. Documented with a clear description
3. Properly formatted with consistent indentation
4. Preserves the exact GEOID values from the source

A few notes about the data:
1. There appear to be some duplicate GEOIDs in the VA list ("51750", "51640", "51520", "51720" appear twice)
2. There's a duplicate GEOID in the NC list ("37089" appears twice)
3. There's a duplicate GEOID in the GA list ("13111" appears twice)
4. There are duplicate GEOIDs in the LA list ("22051" and "22093" appear twice)

Would you like me to clean up these duplicates, or would you prefer to keep them as they are in the source data?
