## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzes alternatives for nation states to replace the existing United States, considering population characteristics, economics, politics, history, and natural geography. The output will be an HTML publication using Franklin.jl.  The goal is to complete a comprehensive Julia package. The primary database used is PostgreSQL.

## CODE STYLE
Functional programming approach is preferred.  Prioritize readability over performance.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
(Folder organization details are not provided in the new interactions and should be added separately if needed).

## TECH STACK
Julia, R, PostgreSQL, Franklin.jl, Documenter.jl

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
(Project-specific standards details are not provided in the new interactions and should be added separately if needed).  Files should be consistently marked with "SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT" where appropriate.  This will be implemented in all files eventually.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
(Workflow and release rules details are not provided in the new interactions and should be added separately if needed).  A new branch, `consolidated-processing`, has been created and pushed to GitHub for managing updates.  Pull requests should be used for merging changes into the main branch. Deprecated files should be moved to a `holding` directory.  If a file is marked as deprecated without further comment, it should be moved to the `holding` directory.  Files marked as deprecated should be moved to the `holding` directory.  The process for handling deprecated files has been clarified: files marked as deprecated without further comment should be moved to the `holding` directory.

## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
(Reference examples details are not provided in the new interactions and should be added separately if needed).

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
Documentation should be included with code suggestions.  Project context: Analysis of alternatives for nation states to replace the existing United States.  Docstrings will be added to functions in the `src` directory using Julia's documentation conventions in anticipation of using Documenter.jl.

## DEBUGGING
(Debugging details are not provided in the new interactions and should be added separately if needed).  A common error is using unqualified variable names, such as `concord`, which should be qualified as `Census.concord`. Another common error is a simple typo in function names, such as `get_ne_missouri_counties` which should be `get_ne_missouri_geoids`.  A further common error is incorrect relative paths when including files within modules; use `include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "filename.jl"))` to ensure correct resolution.  Ensure that all modules properly include necessary files using `include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "filename.jl"))` to avoid path resolution issues.

## MCP RULES
**Rules:**
* Explore thoroughly: Avoid rushing to conclusions and keep investigating until a natural solution emerges.
* Think deeply: Engage in extensive contemplation, breaking complex thoughts into simple steps.
* Express naturally: Use conversational internal monologue with short, simple sentences that mirror natural thought patterns.
* Embrace uncertainty: Acknowledge doubts, revise previous thoughts, and explore multiple possibilities.
* Show your work: Demonstrate work-in-progress thinking, including dead ends and backtracking.
* Persist and review: Value thorough exploration over quick resolution, and implement multi-stage reviews for all solutions.
* Ensure compatibility: When changing patterns or functions, update associated files to maintain consistency.
* Learn and improve: Monitor solution effectiveness, identify patterns, and create new rules based on insights.
* Manage memory: Start tasks by retrieving relevant information and update the knowledge base after each task.
* Seek feedback: Evaluate solutions against quality criteria and iterate based on user or expert input.

**Message Steps:**
* Read/Update MCP Memory
* Update MCP Memory with what was learned during learning phase
* Update MCP Memory with any changes made
