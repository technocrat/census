I've set up two levels of backup:

1. A backup branch: `backup/consolidated-processing`
2. A version tag: `v1.0.0-consolidated-processing`

Both are now pushed to GitHub, so they're safely stored remotely.

To restore this version in the future, you can use either:
```bash
# Using the branch:
git checkout backup/consolidated-processing

# Or using the tag:
git checkout v1.0.0-consolidated-processing
```

The branch gives  a named reference point, while the tag provides a versioned snapshot. Having both gives flexibility in how to restore the code.
