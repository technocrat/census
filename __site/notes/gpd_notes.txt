1.1  Virginia
The two "Richmond" entries in Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) GDP tables refer to Richmond City and Richmond County, which are distinct entities in Virginia. This can be confusing because Virginia's political geography is unique:
	1	Richmond City: An independent city in Virginia, which means it is not part of any county. Independent cities in Virginia are considered separate from the surrounding counties for administrative and statistical purposes. Richmond City is the capital of Virginia and has its own government and economy.
	2	Richmond County: A rural county in northeastern Virginia, located along the Rappahannock River. It is entirely separate from Richmond City and has its own distinct economy and governance.
Why Two "Richmonds" in GDP Tables?
The BLS and BEA categorize data by both counties and independent cities, which are treated as equivalent units. Since Richmond City and Richmond County are separate jurisdictions, each gets its own entry in the data tables. This ensures accuracy in representing the economic activity of each area.
To differentiate between them:
	•	Richmond City might appear as "Richmond (City)" or simply "Richmond."
	•	Richmond County will usually be labeled explicitly as a "County" or identified by its county code.
If you're analyzing GDP data, it's essential to verify whether the data refers to Richmond City or Richmond County by cross-referencing with the geographic codes or additional descriptors provided.

Visual-Meta Appendix

This is where your document comes alive. The information in very small type below allows software to provide rich interactions with this document.
See Visual-Meta.info for more information.

This is what we call Visual-Meta. It is an approach to add information about a document to the document itself on the same level of the content. The same as would be necessary on a physically printed page, as opposed to a data layer, since this data layer can be lost and it makes it harder for a user to take advantage of this data. ¶ Important notes are primarily about the encoding of the author information to allow people to cite this document. When listing the names of the authors, they should be in the format ‘last name’, a comma, followed by ‘first name’ then ‘middle name’ whilst delimiting discrete authors with  (‘and’) between author names, like this: Shakespeare, William and Engelbart, Douglas C. ¶ Dates should be ISO 8601 compliant. ¶ The way reader software looks for Visual-Meta in a PDF is to parse it from the end of the document and look for @{visual-meta-end}. If this is found, the software then looks for {@{visual-meta-start} and uses the data found between these marker tags. ¶ It is very important to make clear that Visual-Meta is an approach more than a specific format and that it is based on wrappers. Anyone can make a custom wrapper for custom metadata and append it by specifying what it contains: For example @dublin-core or @rdfs. ¶ This was written Summer 2021.
