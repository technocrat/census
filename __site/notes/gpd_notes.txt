1.1  Virginia
The two "Richmond" entries in Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) GDP tables refer to Richmond City and Richmond County, which are distinct entities in Virginia. This can be confusing because Virginia's political geography is unique:
	1	Richmond City: An independent city in Virginia, which means it is not part of any county. Independent cities in Virginia are considered separate from the surrounding counties for administrative and statistical purposes. Richmond City is the capital of Virginia and has its own government and economy.
	2	Richmond County: A rural county in northeastern Virginia, located along the Rappahannock River. It is entirely separate from Richmond City and has its own distinct economy and governance.
Why Two "Richmonds" in GDP Tables?
The BLS and BEA categorize data by both counties and independent cities, which are treated as equivalent units. Since Richmond City and Richmond County are separate jurisdictions, each gets its own entry in the data tables. This ensures accuracy in representing the economic activity of each area.
To differentiate between them:
	•	Richmond City might appear as "Richmond (City)" or simply "Richmond."
	•	Richmond County will usually be labeled explicitly as a "County" or identified by its county code.
If you're analyzing GDP data, it's essential to verify whether the data refers to Richmond City or Richmond County by cross-referencing with the geographic codes or additional descriptors provided.
