# Conversation 1: Importing CSV Data into PostgreSQL

## My Actions
1. Checked the existence of 2024_gop.csv and 2024_dem.csv files
2. Examined the structure of the CSV files
3. Verified PostgreSQL was running using pg_isready
4. Checked the structure of the census.variable_data table
5. Imported Republican data from 2024_gop.csv:
sql
   BEGIN;
   CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_gop (geoid varchar(5), value bigint);
   COPY temp_gop FROM '/Users/ro/projects/census/data/2024_gop.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
   INSERT INTO census.variable_data (geoid, variable_name, value)
   SELECT t.geoid, 'republican', t.value
   FROM temp_gop t
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM census.counties c WHERE c.geoid = t.geoid);
   DROP TABLE temp_gop;
   COMMIT;
   BEGIN;
   CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_dem (geoid varchar(5), value bigint);
   COPY temp_dem FROM '/Users/ro/projects/census/data/2024_dem.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
   INSERT INTO census.variable_data (geoid, variable_name, value)
   SELECT t.geoid, 'democratic', t.value
   FROM temp_dem t
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM census.counties c WHERE c.geoid = t.geoid);
   DROP TABLE temp_dem;
   COMMIT;
   Result: Imported 3,160 rows, inserted 3,116 rows
6. Imported Democratic data from 2024_dem.csv using the same approach:
sql
   Result: Imported 3,160 rows, inserted 3,116 rows

## Summary
- Successfully imported data from both CSV files into the PostgreSQL table census.variable_data
- Data from 2024_gop.csv was imported with variable_name='republican'
- Data from 2024_dem.csv was imported with variable_name='democratic'
- 44 rows from each file were skipped because their geoid values weren't in the census.counties table

# Conversation 2: Finding Missing GEOIDs

## My Actions
1. Created a query to identify the missing geoids:
   BEGIN;
   CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_gop (geoid varchar(5), value bigint);
   COPY temp_gop FROM '/Users/ro/projects/census/data/2024_gop.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
   SELECT t.geoid FROM temp_gop t LEFT JOIN census.counties c ON t.geoid = c.geoid WHERE c.geoid IS NULL ORDER BY t.geoid;
   DROP TABLE temp_gop;
   COMMIT;
## Result
Found 44 missing geoids that weren't inserted into the database:
02001   02002   02003   02004   02005   02006   02007   02008   02009   02010
02011   02012   02014   02015   02017   02018   02019   02021   02022   02023
02024   02025   02026   02027   02028   02029   02030   02031   02032   02033
02034   02035   02036   02037   02038   02039   02040   11002   11003   11004
11005   11006   11007   11008
## Analysis
- Most missing geoids start with "02" (Alaska's FIPS state code)
- A few start with "11" (District of Columbia's FIPS state code)
- These likely represent boroughs/census areas in Alaska and wards in DC that aren't defined as counties in the census.counties table
