# Commonalities

The new nations face individual challenges but also share share some important obstacles to long-term success. Some of these are not new and some arise because of separation.

## Demographics

All of the nations face demographic challenges. Declining birth rates will result in an increasingly larger portion of the population becoming older. The dependency ratio of the number of persons older than 65 over the working age population of 16-64 will increase in the absense of immigration. Nations that are able to attract immigrants will better be able to deal with this than those that aren't. Immigrants can come from two sourcesâ€”the other new nations or abroad. Continuing to avoid xenophobia and encouraging a blended immigration stream that does not give rise to ethnic rivalries will be something to attend to.

## Climate change

Rising sea levels, drought, more frequent and intense storms and colder winters are some of the effects of climate change. Different nations will be subject to different effects, but all must adjust.

## Diversity

Populations with a higher degree of diversity are better equipped to deal with changes. Some nations will tend toward higher degrees while other will remain dominantly white.

## Economics

Some nations have low dependence on natural resources, and their economy won't be directly affected by depletion of such commodities as oil and minerals. Knowledge based economies will continue to rely on investment in primary and secondary education.

## Geopolitics

Nations in the northern tier can  be expected to cultivate friendly relations with Canada. There are no obvious reasons for the new nations to come into conflict with each other. As China emerges as the global hemegon, the nations will have to adjust. Each would do well to continue to look to Europe as a major trade partner.

## Governance

New nations with diverse demographic and economic profiles, will need constitutions  to strike a balance between democratic majority rule, which favors urban concentrations, and place-based autonomy for rural regions. Nations should be cautious to not bake in geographic divisions in political power, however, so that as political and social differences and commonalities develop that power dynamic can adjust accordingly.
