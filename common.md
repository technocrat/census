# Commonalities

The new nations face individual challenges but also share share some important obstacles to long-term success. Some of these are not new and some arise because of separation.

## Demographics

All of the nations face demographic challenges. Declining birth rates will result in an increasingly larger portion of the population becoming older. The dependency ratio of the number of persons older than 65 over the working age population of 16-64 will increase in the absense of immigration. Nations that are able to attract immigrants will better be able to deal with this than those that aren't. Immigrants can come from two sourcesâ€”the other new nations or abroad. Continuing to avoid xenophobia and encouraging a blended immigration stream that does not give rise to ethnic rivalries will be something to attend to.

## Climate change

Rising sea levels, drought, more frequent and intense storms and colder winters are some of the effects of climate change. Different nations will be subject to different effects, but all must adjust.

## Diversity

Populations with a higher degree of diversity are better equipped to deal with changes. Some nations will tend toward higher degrees while other will remain dominantly white.

## Economics

Concordia has low dependence on natural resources, and its economy won't be directly affect by depletion of such commodities as oil and minerals. Concordia's knowledge based economy will continue to rely on investment in primary and secondary education.

## Geopolitics

Concordia can be expected to cultivate friendly relations with Canada to its north and Metropolis to its west. It has no obvious reasons to come into conflict with China, as it emerges as the global hemegon. It will continue to look to Europe as a major trade partner.

## Governance

Because Concordia's state have diverse demographic and economic profiles, its constitution will have to strike a balance between democratic majority rule, which favors urban Massachusetts and Connecticut and place-based autonomy. It should be cautious not to bake in geographic divisions in political power, however, so that as political and social differences and commonalities develop that power dynamic can adjust accordingly.
