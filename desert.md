The states of Desert export \$37.3 billion in goods.

### Manufacturing

In 2024, Utah goods exports were \$18.2 billion. The state's largest manufacturing export category is primary metal manufacturing, followed by computer and electronic products, chemicals, miscellaneous manufactured commodities and transportation equipment.

In 2024, Colorado goods exports were \$10.5 billion. The state's largest manufacturing export category is food & kindred products, followed by computer and electronic products, machinery, chemicals and transportation equipment. 


In 2024, Idaho exported \$4.2 billion of goods to the world. The state's largest manufacturing export category is food and kindred products, followed by computer and electronic products, chemicals, machinery and primary metal manufacturing.

In 2024, Montana goods exports were \$2.4 billion. The state's largest manufacturing export category is chemicals, followed by machinery, transportation equipment, primary metal manufacturing and nonmetallic mineral products.

In 2024, Wyoming goods exports were \$2.1 billion. The state's largest manufacturing export category is chemicals, followed by computer and electronic products, machinery, petroleum and coal products and transportation equipment.

### Agriculture

Colorado's food and agriculture industry generates over \$5 billion in economic output annually from livestock, wheat, corn, barley, potatoes, hay, and specialty crops like cantaloupe and lettuce.The market value of agricultural products in Utah exceeds \$2.3 billion annually, with livestock and dairy being significant contributors. Montana's agricultural products are valued at over \$4.5 billion annually, with cattle and wheat being major contributors. Idaho grows potatoes, wheat, barley, hay and sugar beets. Wyoming produces livestock, hay, alfalfa, and small grains like wheat and barley.

### Resource Extraction

Oil and natural gas dominate Colorado's mineral production value, accounting for ~88% of its total mineral and energy production. Colorado is the 11th largest coal producer in the U.S., the second-largest producer of molybdenum in the U.S. and a key producer of gold.

Utah is home to the Bingham Canyon Mine, one of the world's largest open-pit copper mines, which also produces gold and silver. Coal mining is significant for energy production in central and southern Utah. Utah produces uranium and has unconventional oil shale, and oil sands.

Montana holds about 30% of U.S. recoverable coal reserves and is a major coal producer from surface mines in the Powder River Basin. Crude oil production mainly occurs in the Bakken Formation in northeastern Montana; refineries process crude oil into various products like gasoline and aviation fuel. Natural gas storage capacity is substantial; Montana houses the largest single underground storage site in the U.S.

The Coeur d'Alene District of Idaho has produced over a billion ounces of silver since 1884. Southeastern Idaho hosts large open-pit phosphate mines used for fertilizer production.

Wyoming leads the nation in coal production with large-scale surface mining operations in the Powder River Basin. It accounts for nearly two-fifths of all U.S. coal mined annually. Wyoming produces crude oil and natural gas and also has vast oil shale reserves. Wyoming contains one-third of U.S. uranium reserves. Wyoming has significant deposits critical for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy technologies.
